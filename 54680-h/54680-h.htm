or even an adequate review of the work of
the Conference on the Limitation of Armament,
nor does it pretend to be the writer’s

rejections and irritations.
These were set down each week of the first
two months of the Conference and were published

</div>

<p class='c007'>When one attempts to set down, with
any degree of candor, his impressions of a
great gathering like the Conference on the
Limitation of Armament, he will find himself
swayed from amusement to irritation,
from hope to despair, from an interest in
the great end to an interest in the game as
it is being played. My hopes and interests
and irritations over the Washington Conference
began weeks before it was called.
What could it do? All around me men and
women were saying, “It will end war,” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>possibly—so deep was the demand in them
that war be ended—believing what they
said. It has always been one of the singular
delusions of people with high hopes
that if nations disarmed there could be no
wars. Take the gun away from the child
and he will never hurt himself. If it were
so easy!</p>

<p class='c000'>Their confidence alarmed the authors of
the Conference. They did not mean disarmament,
but limitation of armament.
Moreover it was not even a Conference <em>for</em>
but one <em>on</em> limitation. This was equivalent
to saying that there were other matters involved
in cutting down arms—the causes
that had brought them into being in the
first place, the belief that only in them was
security, and that if you were to do away
with them you must find a substitute, and
a way to make this substitute continually
effective. That is, there were several problems
for the Conference to solve if they
were to put a limit to armaments, and they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>were not easy problems. But those who
kept their eyes on disarmament, pure and
simple, refused to face them.</p>

<p class='c000'>Along with the many who believed the
coming Conference could say the magic
word were not a few—the sophisticated,
who from the start said: “Well, of course,
you don’t expect anything to come out of
it.” Or, “Are you not rather naïve to suppose
that they will do anything?” And
generally the comment was followed by
“Of course nothing came from Paris.”</p>

<p class='c000'>This superior attitude—sometimes vanity,
sometimes disillusionment, sometimes
resentment at trying any new form of international
dealing—was quite useless to
combat. You had an endless task of course
if you attacked them on the point of nothing
coming out of Paris when you believed profoundly
that a great deal of good, as well as
much evil, had come out of Paris, and that
the good is bound to increase and the evil to
diminish as time goes on.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>Very singular, the way that people dismiss
the treaty of Versailles, drop it out
of count as a thing so bungling and evil
that it is bound to eventuate only in wars,
bound to be soon upset. The poor human
beings that made the treaty of Versailles
lacked omniscience, to be sure, and they certainly
strained their “fourteen points,” but
it will be noted that not a few of the arrangements
that they made are working
fairly well.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moreover, what the Superior forget is
that that treaty had an instrument put into
it intended for its own correction. The
Covenant of the League of Nations is a part
of the treaty of Versailles and it says very
specifically that if at any time in the future
any treaty—if that means anything it
must include the treaty of Versailles—becomes
“inapplicable,” works disturbance
between the nations instead of peace, the
League may consider it.</p>

<p class='c000'>The belief in political magic on one side
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>and doubt of all new political ventures on
the other, made the preliminary days of the
Washington Conference hard for the simple-minded
observer, prepared to hope for the
best and to take no satisfaction in the
worst, not to ask more than the conferring
powers thought they could safely undertake,
to believe that the negotiators would
be as honest as we can expect men to be,
and that within the serious limits that are
always on negotiators, would do their best.</p>

<p class='c000'>One had to ask himself, however, what
substantial reasons, if any, he had that the
Conference would be able to do the things
that it had set down as its business. This
business was very concisely laid down in an
agenda, divided into two parts and running
as follows:</p>

<p class='c013'><em>Limitation of Armaments</em>:</p>

<p class='c014'>(1) Limitation of naval armaments under which
shall be discussed the following:</p>

<p class='c015'>(A) Basis of limitation</p>

<p class='c015'>(B) Extent</p>

<p class='c015'>(C) Fulfillment</p>

<p class='c015'>(D) Rules for control of new agencies of warfare</p>

<p class='c015'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>(E) Limitation of land armaments.</p>

<p class='c014'><em>Far Eastern Questions</em>:</p>

<p class='c015'>(1) Questions relating to China</p>

<p class='c016'>First. Principles to be applied</p>

<p class='c016'>Second. Application</p>

<p class='c017'>Subjects:</p>

<p class='c018'>(A) Territorial integrity</p>

<p class='c018'>(B) Administrative integrity</p>

<p class='c018'>(C) Open door</p>

<p class='c018'>(D) Concessions, monopolies, preferential
privileges</p>

<p class='c018'>(E) Development of railways, including
plans relative to the
Chinese Eastern Railway</p>

<p class='c018'>(F) Preferential railway rates</p>

<p class='c018'>(G) Status of existing commitments.</p>

<p class='c014'><em>Siberia</em>:</p>

<p class='c015'>Sub-headings the same as those under China.</p>

<p class='c014'><em>Mandated Islands</em>:</p>

<p class='c015'>Sub-headings the same as those under China with
railway sections eliminated.</p>

<p class='c019'>What reasons were there for thinking
that the nations—England, France, Italy,
China, Japan, Belgium, Holland, Portugal—could,
with the United States, handle
these problems of the Pacific in such a way
that they would be able to cut their armaments,
and, cutting them, find a satisfactory
substitute. There were several reasons.</p>

<p class='c019'>A first, and an important one, was that
the difficulties to be adjusted were, as defined,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>confined to one side only of the earth’s
surface which, if huge, is nevertheless fairly
simple, being mostly water. It was the
problems of the Pacific Ocean that they prepared
to handle. These problems are comparatively
definite—the kind of thing that
you can get down on paper with something
like precision. They had one great advantage,
and that is that in the main they did
not involve a past running into the dim distance.
England has held Hongkong for
only about eighty years. We, the United
States, have had port privileges in China
only since 1844. France first got a stronghold
in Cochin China in 1862, and her protectorate
over Annam is less than forty
years old. It was only twenty-five years ago
that the war between Japan and China over
Korea began; the complications in eastern
Russia are still younger. So are those in
Shantung, Yap, the Philippine Islands.
That is, the chief bones of contention in the
Conference were freshly picked. In most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>of the cases there were men still living who
helped in the picking.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was the same when it came to concessions.
The question of the ownership and
administration of railroads and mines—they
belong to our age. We can put our
fingers on their beginnings, trace with some
certainty what has happened, find the intriguers,
the bribe givers and takers, the
law breaker, if such there have been. In
the case of most of the concessions we can
get our hands upon the very men involved
in securing them and in carrying on their
development.</p>

<p class='c019'>How different from the problems of Europe,
running as they do through century
after century, involving as they do successions
of invasions, of settlements, of conquests,
of incessant infiltration of different
races, and the consequent mingling of
social, political, industrial and religious
notions. The quarrels of Europe are as
old as its civilization, their bases are lost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>in the past. Without minimizing at all the
difficulty of the questions on the agenda of
the Conference, they did have the advantage
of being of recent date.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was encouragement in the relations
of the conferees. These were not
enemy nations, fresh from wars, meeting to
make treaties. They were nations that for
five years had been allies, and from the life-and-death
necessity of coöperation had
gained a certain solidarity. True, their
machinery of coöperation was pretty well
shot up. The frictions of peace are harder
on international machinery than the shells
of war. The former racks it to pieces; the
latter solidifies it. Nevertheless, the nations
that were coming to the Conference
were on terms of fairly friendly acquaintance,
an acquaintance which had stood a
tremendous test.</p>

<p class='c019'>These nations had all committed themselves
solemnly to certain definite ideals,
laid down by the United States of America.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>True, their ideals were badly battered, and
as a government we were in the anomalous
position of temporarily abandoning them
after having committed our friends to them.
However, they still stood on their feet,
these ideals.</p>

<p class='c019'>It could be counted as an advantage that
the associations of the years of the War
had made the men who would represent the
different nations at the Conference fairly
well acquainted with one another. Whatever
disappointments there might be in the
delegations we could depend upon it that
the men chosen would be tried men. They
were pretty sure to be men of trustworthy
character, with records of respectable
achievement, men like Root and Hughes
and Underwood in our own delegation.
They would not come unknown to each
other or unknown to the nations involved.
It would be a simple matter for us, the
public, to become acquainted with their
records. If by any unhappy chance there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>should be among them a political intriguer,
that, too, would be known.</p>

<p class='c019'>These were all good reasons for expecting
that the Conference might do something
of what it started out for. How much of it
it would do and how permanent that which
it did would be would depend in no small
degree upon the attitude of mind of this
country, whether the backing that we gave
the Conference was one of emotionalism or
intelligence. We were starting out with a
will to succeed; we were going to spend our
first day praying for success. It would be
well if we injected into those prayers a
supplication for self-control, clearness of
judgment, and willingness to use our minds
as well as our hearts in the struggles that
were sure to come.</p>

<p class='c019'>Alarms went along with these hopes.
There were certain very definite things that
might get in the way of the success of the
Conference—things that often frustrate the
best intentions of men, still they were matters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>over which the public and the press
would have at least a certain control, if
they took a high and intelligent view of
their own responsibility.</p>

<p class='c019'>First, there were the scapegoats. There
are bound to be periods in all human undertakings
when the way is obscure, when failure
threatens, when it is obvious that certain
things on which we have set our hearts
are unobtainable. Irritation and discouragement
always characterize these
periods. It is here that we fall back on a
scapegoat. An international conference
usually picks one or more before it gets
through—a nation which everybody combines
to call obstinate, unreasonable,
greedy, a spoke in the wheel. Then comes
a hue and cry, a union of forces—not to
persuade but to overwhelm the recalcitrant,
to displace it, drive it out of court.
The spirit of adjustment, and of accommodation
which is of the very essence of success
in an undertaking like the Conference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>on the Limitation of Armaments is always
imperiled and frequently ruined by fixing
on a scapegoat. Would this happen at
Washington?</p>

<p class='c019'>Of course the nation on which irritation
and suspicion were concentrated might be
in the wrong. It might be deep in evil intrigue.
It might be shockingly greedy. But
it was a member of the Conference and the
problem must be worked out <em>with</em> it. You
work nothing out with scapegoats. Abraham
Lincoln once laid down a principle of
statesmanship which applies. “<em>Honest
statesmanship</em>,” he said, “<em>is the employment
of individual meanness for the public
good</em>.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It takes brains, humor, self-control to put
any such rule as this in force. If unhappily
the Conference did not furnish a sufficient
amount of these ingredients, would
the press and public make good the deficit?
They are always in a strategic position
where they can insist that everybody must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>be considered innocent until he is proved
guilty, that nothing be built on suspicion,
everything on facts. Something very important
for them to remember if they insisted
was that these facts had a history,
that they were not isolated but related to a
series of preceding events. For instance,
there was the high hand that Japan had
played with China. We must admit it.
But in doing so we must not forget that
it was only about sixty years ago that the
very nations with whom Japan was now
to meet in council in Washington had gathered
with their fleets in one of her ports
and used their guns to teach her the beauties
of Christian civilization. She had decided
to learn their lessons. She has wonderful
imitative powers. She had <em>followed</em>
them into China, and if she had played a
higher hand there than any of them—and
there might be a question as to that—it
should be remembered that she had only
sixty years in which to learn the degree of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>greed that can safely be practiced in our
modern civilization. We must consider
that possibly she had not had sufficient
time to learn to temper exploitation with
civilized discretion.</p>

<p class='c019'>No scapegoats. No hues and cries. And
certainly no partisanship. Was it possible
for the United States to hold a truly national
parley, one in which party ambitions
and antipathies did not influence the negotiations?
We had had within three years a
terrible lesson of the lengths to which men’s
partisanship will go in wrecking even the
peace of the world. Would we repeat that
crime? It was an ugly question, and be as
optimistic as I would I hated to face it.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was another danger on the face of
things—crudeness of opinion. We love to
be thought wise. There are thousands of
us who in the pre-Conference days were
getting out our maps to find out where Yap
lay or the points between which the Eastern
Chinese railroad ran, who would be tempted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>sooner or later to become violent partisans
of, we will say: Yap for America—Shantung
for China—Vladivostok for the Far
Eastern Republic. There was danger in
obstinate views based on little knowledge
or much knowledge of a single factor.</p>

<p class='c019'>And there were the sacrifices. Were we
going to accept beforehand that if we were
to have the limitation of armament which
we desired—we, the United States might
have to sacrifice some definite thing—a
piece of soil, a concession, a naval base in
the Pacific—and that nothing more fatal
to the success of the Conference could be
than for us to set our teeth and say: “We
must have this”—quite as fatal as setting
our teeth and saying: “This or that nation
must do this.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But my chief irritation in these pre-Conference
days lay with the agenda. It was
illogical to place limitation of armament at
the head of the program. That was an
effect—not a cause. It looked like an attempt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>to make reduction of taxes more important
than settlement of difficulties.
Was the Conference to be merely a kind of
glorified international committee on tax reduction?
Not that I meant to underestimate
the relief that would bring.</p>

<p class='c019'>Suppose the Conference should say: We
will reduce at once—by the simplest, most
direct method—cut down fifty per cent. of
our appropriations—for five years and before
the term is ended meet again and make
a new contract.</p>

<p class='c019'>What a restoration of the world’s hope
would follow! How quickly the mind
sprang to what such a decision would bring
to wretched, jobless peoples—the useful
work, the schools, the money for more
bread, better shelter, leisure for play. How
much of the resentment at the huge sums
now going into warships, cannon, naval
bases, war colleges, would evaporate.</p>

<p class='c019'>The mere announcement would soothe
and revive. Labor bitterly resents the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>thought that it may be again asked to
spend its energies in the creation of that
which destroys men instead of that which
makes for their health and happiness.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Get them to plowing again, to popping
corn by their own firesides, and you
can’t get them to shoulder a musket again
for fifty years,” Lincoln said of the soldiers
that the approaching end of the Civil
War would release. As a matter of fact—suppression
of the Indians aside—it was
only thirty-three years when they were at
it again, but there was no great heart in
the enterprise; they still preferred their
“plows and popcorn,” and the experience
of the Great War had only intensified that
feeling.</p>

<p class='c019'>Cut down armament now merely for sake
of reducing taxation and you would give
the world’s love of peace a chance to grow—and
that was something. But it was
something which must be qualified.</p>

<p class='c019'>The history of man’s conduct shows that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>however much he desires his peaceful life,
the moment what he conceives to be his
country’s interest—which he looks at as his
interest—is threatened, he will throw his
tools of peace into the corner and seize those
of war. It does not matter whether he is
prepared or not. Men always have and,
unless we can find something beside force
to appeal to in a pinch, always will do just
as they did at Lexington, as the peasants
of Belgium did at the rumor of the advance
of the Germans—seize any antiquated kicking
musket or blunderbuss they can lay
their hands on and attack.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was another significant possibility
to limitation, on which the lovers of peace
rightfully counted—certainly believers in
war do not overlook it—and that was the
chance that the enforced breathing spell
would give for improving and developing
peace machinery. It would give a fresh
chance to preach the new methods, arouse
faith in them, stir governments to greater
interest in them and less in arms.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>It was a possibility—but to offset it experience
shows that with the passing of the
threat of war, interest in pacific schemes is
generally left to a few tireless and little
considered groups of non-official people.
Active interest inside governments dies out.
The great peace suggestions and ventures of
the world have been born of wars fought
rather than of wars that might be fought.
The breathing spell long continued might
end in a general rusting and neglect of the
very methods for preventing wars which
peace lovers are now pushing.</p>

<p class='c019'>What it all amounted to was that the
most drastic limitation was no sure guarantee
against future war. Take away a
man’s gun and it is no guarantee that he
will not strike if aroused. You must get
at the man—enlarge his respect for order,
his contempt for violence, change his notion
of procedure in disputes, establish his
control. It takes more than “gun toting”
to make a dangerous citizen, more than relieving
him of his gun to make a safe one.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>If the Conference only cut down the number
of guns the nations were carrying, it
would have done little to insure permanent
peace. The President’s conference on
unemployment which held its sessions just
before the Conference on the Limitation of
Armament spent considerable time in considering
what the industry of the country
might do to prevent industrial crises.
Among the principles it laid down was one
quite as applicable to international as to
business affairs.</p>

<p class='c019'>“<em>The time to act is before a crisis has become
inevitable.</em>”</p>

<p class='c019'>That was the real reason for the existence
of the coming Conference—to act before
the jealousies and misunderstandings
around the Pacific had gone so far that
there was no solution <em>but</em> war. Let us suppose
that in 1913 say, England, France,
Germany, Austria and Russia had held a
conference over an agenda parallel to the
one now laid down for the Washington Conference—one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>that not only considered limiting
their armies and navies but boldly and
openly attacked the fears, the jealousies,
the needs, and the ambitions of them all—might
it not have been possible that they
would have found a way other than war?
Are governments incapable in the last analysis
of settling difficulties save by force and
exhaustion, or are they made impotent by
the idea that no machinery and methods for
handling international affairs are possible
save the ones which have so often landed
their peoples in the ditch?</p>

<p class='c019'>In his farewell words to this country at
the end of his recent visit, the late Viscount
Bryce remarked that anybody could
frighten himself with a possibility but the
course of prudence was to watch it and estimate
the likelihood that it would ever enter
into the sphere of probability.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is just here that governments have fallen
down worst. They might watch the
war possibilities, but they have refused or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>not been able to evaluate them. They
seemed to have felt usually that closing
their eyes to them or at least refusing to
admit them was the only proper diplomatic
attitude.</p>

<p class='c019'>As a rule, it has been the non-responsible
outsider that has exploited war possibilities.
Sometimes this has been done from
the highest motives, with knowledge and
restraint. More often it has been done on
half-knowledge and with reckless indifference
to results. There are always a number
of people around with access to the public
ear who love to handle explosives—never
quite happy unless their imaginations are
busy with wars and revolutions. There are
others possessed by the pride of prophecy—their
vanity is demonstrating the inevitable
strife in the situation. They are the
makers of war scares—the breeders and
feeders of war passions. Sometimes war
possibilities are the materials for skillful
national propaganda—the agent of one nation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>working on a second to convince it of
the hostile intent of a third.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is the governments concerned that
should be handling this sort of stuff and
handling it in such a way that they would
cut under the malicious and the wanton,
get at the real truth and get at it in time
and get it out to the world.</p>

<p class='c019'>One of the chief reasons for some sort of
active association of nations is that there
should be a permanent central agency always
working over war possibilities, estimating
them, heading them off.</p>

<p class='c019'>Present diplomacy does not do it. Could
the coming Conference find a way for just
this service in the Pacific situation?</p>

<p class='c019'>How could the public be sure the Conference
was really seeking these ends? Only
by openness and frankness. Could one
really expect that? No one of sense and
even a very little knowledge of how men
achieve results, whether in statecraft or in
business, would think for a moment that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Conference must sit daily in open session
with a public listening to all that it said.
There was only one practical way of handling
the agenda. The Conference must
form itself into groups, each charged with a
subject on which it was to arrive at some
kind of understanding. The report must
be presented at the Conference. But when
this was done there should be free, open
discussion.</p>

<p class='c019'>To handle the plenary sessions of the
present Conference as they were handled in
Paris in 1919 would be a tragic mistake.
These plenary conferences were splendidly
set scenes. No one who looked on the gathering
at which the Covenant of the League
of Nations was presented would ever forget
it. Nor would he forget how the gloved-and-iron
hand of Clemenceau never for a
moment released its grip; how effectively,
for example, the incipient revolt against
the mandate system aimed at making nations
the protectors and not the exploiters
of the German territories to be disposed of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>was soft-pedaled. Nor would he ever forget
certain sinister faces in the great picture
that chilled at their birth the high
hopes which the Conference championed.</p>

<p class='c019'>Free discussion, running, if you please,
over days at this juncture, might have insured
an easier, straighter road for the
treaty of Versailles and particularly for the
League of Nations.</p>

<p class='c019'>Frankness would be the greatest ally of
all who looked on the great mission of the
coming Conference as preventing the Pacific
crisis from ever ending in war. Frankness
would break the war bubbles that the irresponsible
were blowing so gayly. It would
be the surest preventive of the fanatical
and partisan drives which are almost certain
to develop if there was unnecessary
secrecy. Naturally, those on the outside
would look on a failure to take the public in
as proof that sinister forces were at work
in the Conference, that dark things were
brewing which must be kept out of sight.</p>

<p class='c019'>As a matter of fact, one look inside would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>probably show a group of worn and anxious
gentlemen honestly doing their best
to find something on which they could
agree with a reasonable hope that the countries
that had sent them to Washington
would accept their decisions. After one
good look the public might change suspicion
to sympathy.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was always the argument from
the conventionally minded that “it isn’t
done,” that diplomacy must be secret. John
Hay didn’t think so. He told his friend
Henry Adams in the course of his efforts
to establish the “open door” in China that
he got on by being “honest and naïf!”</p>

<p class='c019'>The point in this policy at which most
people, in and out of the present Conference,
would stick is that word “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïf</span>.”
They would prefer to be thought dishonest
rather than simple-minded. However, if
everybody who had a part in the gathering
could be as simple-minded as he was in
fact, would pretend to know no more than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>he did in truth and would be as honest as
it was in his nature to be, there would be
a good chance of keeping Mr. Hay’s door in
China open. And if that could be done
along with the other things it implied, the
Conference would have actually contributed
to the chances of more permanent peace in
the world and could cut down its armaments,
because it had less need of them, not
merely because it wanted temporarily to reduce
taxation.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <span class='large'>ARMISTICE DAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>It was the Unknown Soldier Boy that
put an end to the doubt, the faultfinding,
the cynicism that was in the air of Washington
as the day for the opening of the
Conference approached. It all became
vanity, pettiness, beside that bier with its
attending thousands of mourning people.</p>

<p class='c019'>They carried the body to the capitol
where for a day it lay in state. Busy with
my attempts to learn something of what it
was all about, it was not until late in the
afternoon that I thought of the ceremony
on the hill, and made my way there for my
daily walk. It had been a soft, sunny day,
the air full of gray haze. Everything
around the great plaza—the Capitol, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>library, the trees, the marble Senate and
House buildings right and left—was tender
in its outline. There were no crowds, but
as I looked I saw massed four abreast from
the entrance door to the rotunda, down
along terraces of steps, across the plaza as
far as I could see, a slowly moving black
mass, kept in perfect line by soldiers standing
at intervals. I made my way across.
Where was its end? I went to find it.</p>

<p class='c019'>I walked the width of the great plaza
and turned down the Avenue. As far as I
could see the people were massed—one
block, two blocks, three blocks, four—and
from every direction you could see men and
women hurrying to fall in line. I had had
no idea of joining that line, of passing
through that rotunda. My only notion was
to take a glimpse of the crowd. But to have
gone on, to have been no part of something
which came upon me as tremendous in its
feeling and meaning, would have been a
withdrawal from my kind of which I think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>I should always have been ashamed. And
so I fell in.</p>

<p class='c019'>The mass moved slowly, but very steadily.
The one strongest impression was of its
quietness. Nobody talked. Nobody seemed
to want to talk. If a question was asked,
the reply was low. We moved on block
after block—turned the corner—now we
faced the Capitol—amazingly beautiful,
proud and strong in the dim light. I never
had so deep a feeling that it was something
that belonged to me, guarded me, meant
something to me, than as I moved slowly
with that great mass toward the bier. The
sentinels stood rigid, as solemn and as
quiet as the people. The only murmur that
one heard was now and then a low singing,
“Nearer My God to Thee.” How it began,
who suggested it, I do not know; but
through all that slow walk, the only thing
that I heard was women’s voices, now behind
me, now before me, humming that air.
It took a full three-quarters of an hour to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>reach the door and pass into the rotunda.
It took strong self-control not to kneel by
the bier. They told me that there were
women, bereft mothers, to whom the appeal
was too much—mothers of missing boys.
This might have been hers. Could she
pass? The guards lifted them very gently,
and in quiet the great crowd moved forward.
I fancy there were thousands that
passed that place that day that will have
always before their eyes that great dim circle
with bank upon bank of flowers, from all
over the earth—flowers from kings and
queens and governments, from great
leaders of armies, from those who labor,
from the mothers of men, and hundreds
upon hundreds from those who went out
with the dead but came back. The only
sound that came to us as we passed was
the clear voice of a boy, one of a group, once
soldiers. They came with a wreath. They
carried a flag. The leader was saying his
farewell to their buddy.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>A hundred thousand or more men and
women made this pilgrimage. A hundred
thousand and many more packed the
streets of Washington the next day when
the bier was carried from the Capitol to
the grave at Arlington.</p>

<p class='c019'>The attending ceremony was one of the
most perfect things of the kind ever
planned. It had the supreme merit of restraint.
Every form of the country’s service
had a place—not too many—a few—but
they were always of the choicest—from
the President of the United States down to
the last marine, the best we had were
chosen to follow the unknown boy.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was an immense sincerity to it all.
They felt it—the vast, inexpressible sorrow
of the war. And no one felt it more than
the President of the United States. What
he said at Arlington, what he was to say
the next day at the opening of the Conference,
showed that with all his heart and
all his mind the man hated the thing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>had brought this sorrow to the country,
and that he meant to do his part to put an
end to it.</p>

<p class='c019'>The ceremony was for the dead sacrifice,
but the feature of it which went deepest to
the heart and brought from the massed
crowds their one instinctive burst of sympathy
and greeting was the passing, almost
at the end of the procession, of the War’s
living sacrifice—Woodrow Wilson.</p>

<p class='c019'>The people had stood in silence, reverently
baring their heads as the bier of the
soldier passed, followed by all the official
greatness of the moment—the President of
the United States, his cabinet, the Supreme
Court, the House, the Senate, Pershing,
Foch. And then, quite unexpectedly, a carriage
came into view—two figures in it—a
white-faced man, a brave woman. Unconscious
of what they were doing, the
crowd broke into a muffled murmur—“Wilson!”
The cry flowed down the long avenue—a
surprised, spontaneous recognition.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>It was as if they said: “You—you of all
living men belong here. It was you who
called the boy we are honoring—you who
put into his eye that wonderful light—the
light that a great French surgeon declared
made him different as a soldier from the
boys of any other nation.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“I don’t know what it is,” he said,
“whether it is God, the Monroe Doctrine or
President Wilson, but the American soldier
has a light in his eye that is not like anything
that I have ever seen in men.” Woodrow
Wilson, under God, had put it there.
His place was with the soldier. The crowd
knew it, and told him so by their unconscious
outburst.</p>

<p class='c019'>His carriage left the procession at the
White House. Later the crowd followed it.
All the afternoon of Armistice Day men
and women gathered before his home. All
told there were thousands of them. They
waited, hoping for his greeting. And when
he gave it, briefly, they cheered and cheered.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>But they did not go away. It was dark before
that crowd had dispersed.</p>

<p class='c019'>But this expression of love and loyalty
and interest in Woodrow Wilson is no new
thing in Washington. For months now, on
Sundays and holidays, men, women and
children have been walking to his home,
standing in groups before it, speaking together
in hushed tones as if something
solemn and ennobling stirred in them.
Curiosity? No. Men chatter and jibe and
jostle in curiosity. These people are silent—gentle—orderly.
You will see them before
the theater, too, when it is known that
he is within, quietly waiting for him to come
out—one hundred, two hundred, five hundred—even
a thousand sometimes, it is said.
They cheer him as he passes—and there
are chokes in their voices—and always
tenderness. Let it be known that he is in
his seat in a theater, and the house will
rise in homage. Let his face be thrown on
a screen, and it will receive a greeting that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>the face of no other living American will
receive. It requires explanation.</p>

<p class='c019'>The people at least recognized him as belonging
to the Conference. And, as a matter
of fact, the Conference never was able
to escape him. Again and again, he appeared
at the table. The noblest words that
were said were but echoes of what he had
been saying through the long struggle. The
President’s great slogan—Less of armaments
and none of war—was but another
way of putting the thing for which he had
given all but his last breath. The best they
were to do—their limitation of armaments,
their substitute to make it possible, were
but following in the path that he had cut.
The difficulties and hindrances which they
were to meet and which were to hamper
both program and final settlements were
but the difficulties and hindrances which he
had met and which hampered his work at
Paris. From the start to the finish of the
Conference on the Limitation of Armament,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>the onlooker recognized both the spirit and
the hand of Woodrow Wilson as the crowd
recognized him on Armistice Day.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was another figure in the memorial
procession which deeply touched the crowd
and which stayed on, uninvited. She came
with the dead soldier boy. She stood by
him night and day as he lay in state, followed
him to the grave in which they laid
him away at Arlington, a symbol of the
nation’s grief over all its missing sons. She
did not go with the crowds. She took her
place at the door of the Conference, and
there, day by day, her solemn voice was
heard.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I am the mother of men. Never before
have I lifted my voice in your councils. I
have been silent because I trusted you. But
to-day I speak because I doubt you. I have
the right to speak, for without me mankind
would end. I bear you with pain, such as
you cannot know. I rear you with sacrifice,
such as you cannot understand. I am the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>world’s perpetual soldier, facing death that
life may be. I do not recoil from my great
task. God laid it on me. I have accepted
it always. I give my youth that the world
may have sons, and I glory in my harvest.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But I bear sons for fruitful lives of labor
and peace and happiness. And what have
you done with my work? To-day I mourn
the loss of more than ten million dead,
more than twenty million wounded, more
than six million imprisoned and missing.
This is the fruit of what you call your Great
War.</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is I who must face death to replace
these dead and maimed boys. I shall do it.
But no longer shall I give them to you unquestioning
as I have in the past, for I
have come to doubt you. You have told
me that you used my sons for your honor
and my protection, but I have begun to read
your books, to listen to your deliberations,
to study your maneuvers; I have learned
that it is not always your honor and my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>protection that drives you to war. Again
and again it is your own love of glory, of
power, of wealth; your hate and contempt
for those that are not of your race, your
color, your point of view. You cannot
longer have my sons for such ends. I ask
you to remold your souls, to make effective
that brotherhood of man of which you talk,
to learn to work together, white and black
and brown and yellow, as becomes the sons
of the same mother.</p>

<p class='c019'>“I shall never leave your councils again.
My daughters shall sit beside you voicing
my command—you shall have done with
war.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <span class='large'>NOVEMBER 12, 1921</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>We shall have to leave November 12,
1921, the opening day of the Conference on
the Limitation of Armament, to History for
a final appraisement. Arthur Balfour told
Mr. Hughes after he had had time to gather
himself together from the shock of the
American program that in his judgment a
new anniversary had been added to the Reconstruction
Movement. “If the 11th of
November,” said Mr. Balfour, “in the minds
of the allied and associated powers, in the
minds perhaps not less of all the neutrals—if
that is a date imprinted on grateful
hearts, I think November 12 will also prove
to be an anniversary welcomed and thought
of in a grateful spirit by those who in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>future shall look back upon the arduous
struggle now being made by the civilized
nations of the world, not merely to restore
pre-war conditions, but to see that war conditions
shall never again exist.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Whatever place it may turn out that November
12 shall hold on the calendar of
great national days, this thing is sure; it
will always be remembered for the shock it
gave Old School Diplomacy. That institution
really received a heavier bombardment
than War, the real objective of the
Conference. The shelling reached its very
vitals, while it only touched the surface of
War’s armor.</p>

<p class='c019'>Diplomacy has always had her vested interests.
They have seemed permanent, impregnable.
What made November 12, 1921,
portentous was its invasion of these vested
interests. Take that first and most important
one—Secrecy. When Secretary
Hughes followed the opening speech of welcome
and of idealism made by President
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>Harding, not with another speech of more
welcome and more idealism, as diplomacy
prescribes for such occasions, but with the
boldest and most detailed program of what
the United States had in mind for the meeting,
Diplomacy’s most sacred interest was
for the moment overthrown. To be sure,
what Secretary Hughes did was made possible
by John Hay’s long struggle to educate
his own countrymen to the idea of open
diplomacy; by what President Wilson tried
to do at the Paris conference. Mr. Wilson
won the people of the world to his principle,
but his colleagues contrived to block
him in the second stage of the Paris game.
Mr. Hughes, building on that experience,
did not wait for consultation with his colleagues.
On his own, in a fashion so unexpected
that it was almost brutal, he threw
not only the program of the United States
on the table, but that which the United
States expected of two—two only, please
notice—of the eight nations she had invited
in, Great Britain and Japan.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>His proposals came one after another exactly
like shells from a Big Bertha!—“It
is now proposed that for a period of ten
years there should be no further construction
of capital ships.” One after another
the program of destruction followed.</p>

<p class='c014'>The United States:—to scrap all capital ships now
under construction along with fifteen old battleships,
in all a tonnage of 845,740 tons;</p>

<p class='c014'>Great Britain:—to stop her four new Hoods and
scrap nineteen capital ships, a tonnage of 583,375
tons;</p>

<p class='c014'>Japan:—abandon her program of ships not laid
down, and scrap enough of existing ones, new and
old, to make a tonnage of 448,928 tons.</p>

<p class='c019'>I once saw a huge bull felled by a sledge
hammer in the hands of a powerful Czecho-Slovac
farm hand. When Mr. Hughes began
hurling one after another his revolutionary
propositions the scene kept flashing
before my eyes, the heavy thud of the
blow on the beast’s head falling on my
ears. I felt almost as if I were being hit
myself, and I confess to no little feeling of
regret that Mr. Hughes should be putting
his proposals so bluntly. “It is proposed
that Great Britain shall,” etc. “It is proposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>that Japan shall,” etc. Would it have
been less effective as a proposal and would
it not have been really more acceptable as
a form if he had said—“We shall propose to
Great Britain to consider so and so.” But,
after all, when you are firing Big Berthas
it is not the amenities that you consider.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Balfour and Sir Auckland Geddes,
sitting where I could look them full in the
face, had just the faintest expression of
“seeing things.” I would not have been
surprised if they had raised their hands in
that instinctive gesture one makes when he
does “see things” that are not there. The
Japanese took it without a flicker of an
eyelash—neither the delegates at the table
nor the rows of attachés and secretaries
moved, glanced at one another, changed expression.
So far as their faces were concerned
Mr. Hughes might have been continuing
the Harding welcome—instead of
calling publicly on them for a sacrifice unprecedented
and undreamed of.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>The program was so big—its presentation
was so impressive (Mr. Hughes looked seven
feet tall that day and his voice was the voice
of the man who years ago arraigned the Insurance
Companies) that one regretted that
there were omissions so obvious as to force
attention. There was a singular one in the
otherwise admirable historical introduction
Mr. Hughes made to his program. He reviewed
there the efforts of the first and
second Hague Conferences to bring about
disarmament—explained the failure—and
jumped from 1907 to 1921 as if in 1919, at
the Paris Peace Conference, man’s most
valiant effort to bring about disarmament
had not been made. He failed to notice
the fact that to this effort scores of peoples
had subscribed, including <em>all</em> of the nations
represented at the council table; that
these nations had been working for two
years in the League of Nations, under circumstances
of indescribable world confusion
and disorganization, to gather the information
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>and prepare a practical plan not
only to limit the world’s arms but to regulate
for good and all private traffic in armaments.
Before Mr. Hughes sat M. Viviani
of France who had been serving on the
Commission charged with this business.
Before him, too, was man after man fresh
from the discussions of the second annual
Assembly of the League. Disarmament and
many other matters pertaining to world
peace had been before them. They came
confident that they had done something of
value at Geneva however small it might be
compared with the immense work still to
be done. Arthur Balfour of England,
Viviani of France, Wellington Koo of
China, Senator Schanzer of Italy, Sastri of
India, Van Karnebeck of Holland—were
among those that heard Mr. Hughes jump
their honest efforts, beginning in 1919, to
bring the armaments of the world to a
police basis. It must have bewildered them
a little—but they are gentlemen who are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>forced by their profession to take hints
quickly—they understood that as far as the
American Conference on Limitation of
Armament was concerned, the League of
Nations was not to exist. From that day,
if you wanted information on the League
from any one of them you had to catch him
in private, and he usually made sure nobody
was listening before he enlightened
you as to his opinions, which invariably
were “not for publication.”</p>

<p class='c019'>One could not but wonder if Mr. Balfour
had this omission in mind when at a
later session he said in speaking of Mr.
Hughes’ review of past disarmament efforts
that “some fragments” had been laid
before the Conference. What Mr. Hughes
really did in ignoring the work for disarmament
carried on at Paris and Geneva in the
last three years was to call attention to it.</p>

<p class='c019'>After all, was it not petty to be irritated
when something so bold and real had been
initiated? Was it not yielding to the desire
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to “rub in” the omission as bad—or
worse—than the omission? As a matter of
fact, the thing going on at the moment was
so staggering that one had no time for more
than a momentary irritation. Mr. Hughes
swept his house on November 12—swept it
off its feet. If secret diplomacy was given
by him such a blow as it never had received
before, diplomatic etiquette was torn to
pieces by the Senate and the House of the
United States, each of which had a section
of the gallery to itself. Possibly their action
was due to a little jealousy. They are
accustomed to holding the center of the deliberative
stage in Washington, and they
always have, possibly always will resent a
little the coming of an outside deliberative
body which for the time being the public
regards as more interesting than themselves.
They made it plain from the start
that they were not awed. The House of
Representatives particularly was a joy to
see if it did make a shocking exhibition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>itself. It looked as if it were at a ball
game and conducted itself in the same way.
It hung over the gallery, lolled in its seats,
and when the President struck his great
note, the words which ought to become a
slogan of the country—“Less of Armament
and None of War”—it rose to its feet and
cheered as if there had been a home run.</p>

<p class='c019'>Having once broke out in unrestrained
cheers, they gave again and again what William
Allen White called “the yelp of democracy.”
Even after the program was
over and the remaining formalities customary
on such occasions were about at an
end, they took things into their own hands
and finished their attack on diplomatic etiquette
by calling for Briand as they might
have called for Babe Ruth. “It isn’t done,
you know,” I heard one young Britisher
say after it was over. But it had been done,
and the chances are that there will be more
of it in the future.</p>

<p class='c019'>If this day does work out to be portentous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>in history, as it possibly may, the time
will come when every country will hang
great historical pictures of the scene in its
public galleries. We should have one, whatever
its fate. And I hope the artist that
does it will not fail to give full value to the
Congress that cracked the proprieties. Let
him take his picture from the further left
side of the auditorium. In this way he can
bring in the House of Representatives. He
can afford to leave out the diplomatic gallery,
as he would have to do from this position.
The diplomatic gallery counted less
than any other group in the gathering.</p>

<p class='c019'>Secrecy and etiquette were not the only
vested interests attacked on November 12,
1921. There was a third that received a
blow—lighter to be sure, but a blow all the
same and a significant one. The exclusive
vested right of man to the field of diplomacy
was challenged. Not by giving a woman a
seat at the table, but by introducing her on
the floor, in an official capacity, a new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>official capacity, rather problematical as yet
as to its outcome—a capacity which if it
ranks lower than that of delegate is still
counted higher than that of expert, since
it brings the privilege of the floor.</p>

<p class='c019'>Behind the American delegation facing
the hall and inside the sacred space devoted
to the principals of the Congress, sat a
group of some twenty-one persons, the representatives
of a new experiment in diplomacy—a
slice of the public brought in to act
as a link between the American delegates
and the public. Four of these delegates
were women—well-chosen women. They
are the diplomatic pioneers of the United
States.</p>

<p class='c019'>Who were those people, why were they
there? I heard more than one puzzled foreign
attaché ask. When you explained that
this was an advisory body, openly recognized
by the government, they continued,
“But why are women included?” They
understood the women in the diplomatic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>gallery, the women in the boxes. It was a
great ceremony. It was quite within established
diplomatic procedure that the ladies
of the official world should smile upon such
an occasion.</p>

<p class='c019'>They understood the few women scattered
among the scores of men in the press
galleries—but women on the floor as part
of the Conference? What did that mean?
It meant, dear sirs, simply this, that man’s
exclusive, vested interest in diplomacy had
been invaded—its masculinity attacked like
its secrecy and propriety. What would
come of the invasion no one could tell.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is doubtful if ever a program has received
heartier acclaim from this country
than that of Mr. Hughes. It stirred by its
boldness, its breadth. “Scrap!” Whoever
had said that word seriously in all the long
discussion of disarmament. Ten years!—the
longest the most sanguine had suggested
was five. It caught the imagination—had
the ring of possibility in it. It might be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>putting the cart before the horse, as I had
been complaining, but it made it practically
certain that the horse would be acquired
even if you had to pay a good round sum
for him, so desirable had the cart been
made.</p>

<p class='c019'>And then the way the nations addressed
picked it up! Three days later their formal
acceptances were made. For England,
Arthur Balfour accepted in principle, declaring
as he did so:</p>

<p class='c019'>“It is easy to estimate in dollars or in
pounds, shillings and pence the saving to
the taxpayer of each of the nations concerned
which the adoption of this scheme
will give. It is easy to show that the relief
is great. It is easy to show that indirectly
it will, as I hope and believe, greatly stimulate
industry, national and international,
and do much to diminish the difficulties
under which every civilized government is
at this time laboring. All that can be
weighed, measured, counted; all that is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>matter of figures. But there is something
in this scheme which is above and beyond
numerical calculation. There is something
which goes to the root, which is
concerned with the highest international
morality.</p>

<p class='c019'>“This scheme, after all—what does it do?
It makes idealism a practical proposition.
It takes hold of the dream which reformers,
poets, publicists, even potentates, as we
heard the other day, have from time to time
put before mankind as the goal to which
human endeavor should aspire.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Japan,” declared Admiral Baron Kato,
“deeply appreciates the sincerity of purpose
evident in the plan of the American Government
for the limitation of armaments.
She is satisfied that the proposed plan will
materially relieve the nations of wasteful
expenditures and cannot fail to make for
the peace of the world.</p>

<p class='c019'>“She cannot remain unmoved by the high
aims which have actuated the American
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>project. Gladly accepting, therefore, the
proposal in principle, Japan is ready to
proceed with determination to a sweeping
reduction in her naval armament.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Italy, through Senator Schanzer, greeted
the proposal as “The first effective step
toward giving the world a release of such
nature as to enable it to start the work of
its economic reconstruction.”</p>

<p class='c019'>France—her Premier, Briand, spoke for
her—slid over the naval program. France,
he said, had already entered on the right
way—the way Mr. Hughes had indicated;
her real interest was elsewhere. “I rather
turn,” said M. Briand, “to another side
of the problem to which Mr. Balfour has
alluded, and I thank him for this. Is it
only a question here of economy? Is it
only a question of estimates and budgets?
If it were so, if that were the only purpose
you have in view, it will be really
unworthy of the great nation that has called
us here.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>“So the main question, the crucial question,
which is to be discussed here, is to
know if the peoples of the world will be at
last able to come to an understanding in
order to avoid the atrocities of war. And
then, gentlemen, when it comes on the
agenda, as it will inevitably come, to the
question of land armament, a question particularly
delicate for France, as you are all
aware, we have no intention to eschew this.
We shall answer your appeal, fully conscious
that this is a question of grave and
serious nature for us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>What more was there to do? England,
Japan and the United States had accepted
“in principle” a program for the limitation
of navies, much more drastic than the majority
of people had dreamed possible. To
be sure the details were still to be worked
out, but that seemed easy. Had not the
Conference finished its work? There were
people that said so. No. Mr. Hughes had
simply awakened the country to what was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>possible if the reasons for armament could
be removed.</p>

<p class='c019'>So far as we, the United States, were concerned,
these reasons were fourfold:</p>

<p class='c014'>(1) Our Pacific possessions. Until we felt reasonably
sure that they were safe from possible attack
by Japan, we must keep our navy and strengthen our
fortifications.</p>

<p class='c014'>(2) The England-Japan pact. We suspected it.
It might be a threat. So long as it existed could we
wisely limit our navy?</p>

<p class='c014'>(3) Our Open Door policy in China. We meant
to stand by that. It had been invaded by Japan in
the Great War; could we reaffirm it now and secure
assurances we trusted that there would be no further
encroachments? If not, could we limit our armament?</p>

<p class='c014'>(4) Our policy of the integrity of nations—China
and Russia. We had announced a “moral trusteeship”
over both. No more carving up. Let them
work it out for themselves. How were we going to
back up that policy?</p>

<p class='c019'>That is, we had possessions and policies
for which we were responsible. Could we
protect them without armament? That depended,
in our judgment, upon England
and Japan. Would they be willing to make
agreements and concessions which would
convince us that they were willing to respect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>our possessions and accept our policies in
the Pacific?</p>

<p class='c019'>If so, what assurances could we give them
in return that would convince them that we
meant to respect their possessions and policies?
How could we prove to them that
they need not fear us?</p>

<p class='c019'>It was within the first month of the Conference
that the answers to these questions
were worked out “in principle” again.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE FRENCH AT THE CONFERENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The morale of an international conference
is easily shaken in the public’s mind.
Seeming delay will do it. Those who look
on feel that whatever is to be done must be
done quickly, that things must go in leaps.
They mistrust days of plain hard work—work
which yields no headlines. It must
be, they repeat, because the negotiators
have fallen on evil times, are intriguing,
bargaining.</p>

<p class='c019'>Two days after Mr. Hughes had laid out
his plan for ship reduction, and it had been
accepted in principle and turned over to
the naval committee, I heard an eager, suspicious
young journalist ask Lord Lee who,
at the end of eight hours of committee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>work—grilling business always—was conducting
a press conference, if they were
really “doing anything.” His tone showed
that he doubted it, that in his judgment
they must be loafing, deceiving the public;
that if they were not, why, by this time the
program ought to be ready for his newspaper.
Lord Lee was very tired, but he
had not lost his sense of humor. He made
a patient answer. But one understood that
there had already begun in Washington
that which one saw and heard so much two
years and a half before in Paris—a feeling
that taking time to work out problems was
a suspicious performance.</p>

<p class='c019'>The calm of steady effort on the part of
the Conference was brief. Mr. Hughes in
closing the second plenary session where
his naval program had been so generously
accepted “in principle,” had said “I express
the wish of the Conference that at an opportune
time M. Briand will enjoy the
opportunity of presenting to the Conference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>most fully the views of France with regard
to the subject of land armaments which we
must discuss.” Mr. Hughes kept that
promise, fixing November 21, nine days
after the opening, as the “opportune time.”</p>

<p class='c019'>The Conference went into M. Briand’s
open session serene, confident, self-complacent.
It came out excited, scared, ruffled
to the very bottom of its soul. In an hour
one-third of Mr. Hughes’ agenda had been
swept away. Could this have been avoided?
I am inclined to think that it would have
been if there had been a larger sympathy,
a better understanding of the French and
their present psychology. If we are to carry
on the world coöperatively, as seems inevitable,
we must have a much fuller knowledge
of one another’s ways and prejudices
and ambitions than was shown at the outset
of the Washington Conference.</p>

<p class='c019'>Back of the commotion that M. Briand
stirred up on November 21 lay the idiosyncrasies
and experiences of France. To understand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>at all the crisis, for so it was
called, one must understand something of
France—that she is a land which through
the centuries has held herself apart as
something special, the élite of the nations.
The people of no country in the civilized
world are so satisfied with themselves and
their aim. There are no people that find
life at home more precious, guard it so carefully,
none who care so little about other
lands, and it might be said, know so little
of other lands.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is only within the last twenty years
that the Frenchman has come to be anything
of a traveler. To-day, in many parts
of France, the young man or young woman
who comes to America has the same prestige
on returning that thirty years ago the
person in towns outside of the Atlantic
border had in his town when he returned
from a trip abroad. I was living in Paris
in the early 90’s when Alphonse Daudet
made a trip to England. It was a public
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>event. Peary discovered the pole with
hardly less newspaper talk.</p>

<p class='c019'>Now this country, so wrapt up in itself
and the carrying out of its notions of life—among
the most precious notions in my
judgment that mankind have—finds itself
for a long period really the center of the
world’s interests. It makes a superhuman
effort, is valiant beyond words, practically
the whole civilized world rallies to its help.
It comes off victorious, and when it gathers
itself together and begins to examine its
condition it finds the ghastly wounds of a
devastated region; the work of centuries so
shattered that it will take centuries to restore
the fertility, beauty, interest. It finds
itself with an appalling debt; with a population
depleted at the point most vital to
a nation, in its young men, threatening the
oncoming generation. It sees its enemy
beaten, to be sure, but with its land practically
unimpaired.</p>

<p class='c019'>France not only had her condition in her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>mind, she had all her past:—reminiscences
of invasions, from Attila on. Old obsessions,
old policies revived:—the belief that
she would never have safety except in a
weak Central Europe—a doctrine she had
repudiated—broke out.</p>

<p class='c019'>She came to the peace table in Paris
under an accepted program which said:
Reparations, but no indemnities. And her
bitterness so overwhelmed her that she forgot
the principle pledge and demanded indemnities
in full. She forgot her pledge to
annex nothing and called for the Rhine
Border. Every effort to reason with her,
to persuade her not to ask the impossible of
her beaten enemy, she interpreted as lack
of sympathy, and pointed to her devastated
region, her debts, her shrunken population.
She accused of injustice those who felt that
mercy is the great wisdom. Justice became
her great cry. Intent on herself, her dreadful
woes, her determination to have the last
pound, she magnified her perils, saw combinations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>against her, and went about in
Europe trying to arm other peoples, to
build up a pro-France party. Any effort
to persuade her that the spirit which underlay
the Versailles Treaty was pro-humanity
and not pro-French embittered and antagonized
her. She resented the English effort
to bring some kind of order into the
Continent. She resented the conclusion of
the world—slow enough though it was—to
let Russia work out her own destiny.</p>

<p class='c019'>No lover of France has any right to overlook
or encourage this attitude. It is the
most dangerous course she could take.
She is building up anti-French antagonisms
in beaten Europe, and she is alienating
countries that want to bring the world
onto a new basis of Good Will and who believe
it can be done.</p>

<p class='c019'>When M. Briand came to the Washington
peace table, he left behind him a country in
this abnormal mood—her thoughts centered
on herself—her needs, her dangers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>M. Briand knew well enough that she would
not see the program that Mr. Hughes had
thrown out as it was intended—a tremendously
bold suggestion for world peace—a
call to the sacrifice that each country must
make if order was to be restored, the awful
losses of recent years repaired. M. Briand
knew that what France expected him to get
at Washington was recognition, sympathy,
guarantees. The last thing that she wanted
brought back was a request to join in a
program of sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c019'>Moreover, M. Briand came to the Conference
at considerable peril to himself. He
was Premier, and in this office he had been
doing as much as he seems to have thought
possible to hold down the military trend of
the country. His policy had been fought
for a year by a strong party, intent on
demonstrating that France was the most
powerful nation on the continent of Europe,
that it was her right and her ambition
to hold first place there. M. Briand’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>friends thought that he should not come to
the United States. But, as he publicly said,
he wanted to come in order to persuade the
Conference that France was not as military
in spirit as much of the world seemed to
believe, that she did want peace, that her
refusals to disarm came from the fact that
she was still threatened by both Germany
and Russia and must either have arms or
guarantees.</p>

<p class='c019'>M. Briand knew the line of argument that
the Hughes program would awaken in
France. This argument was admirably set
forth early in the Conference by the semi-official
<cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Temps</span></cite>:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I. Under a régime of limited armaments such
as that of which Mr. Hughes has defined the basis,
each state has the right to possess force proportioned
to the dangers to which, in the opinion of all the
contracting powers, it may reasonably believe itself
to be exposed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“II. When powers agree among themselves to
limit their armaments they oblige themselves by that
very fact even though tacitly aiding that one of
themselves which should find itself at grips with a
danger which its limited armaments would not allow
it to subdue.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>“III. It is not possible to have a contractual
limitation of armament without there being at the
same time among all the contractants a joint and
several obligation of mutual aid.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It is not unfair, I think, to say that when
M. Briand came to speak to the Washington
Conference on November 21, he was not
thinking of the peace of the world; he was
thinking of the needs and ambitions of
France. Moreover, his mood was not the
most conciliatory in the world. His pride
and his pride for his country had been
deeply wounded on the opening day of the
Conference. He had found himself on that
occasion set at one side. To be sure, he
and his colleagues were given a position at
the right of the American delegates, Great
Britain being at the left; but when Mr.
Hughes presented his naval program,
France did not figure in it, except incidentally.
The whole discussion was centered
on Great Britain, Japan and the
United States. France and Italy were set
aside with the casual remark that it was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>thought necessary to discuss their tonnage
allowance at that time.</p>

<p class='c019'>Did Mr. Hughes lack tact and understanding
when he confined his opening speech to
three nations? I think that the after
events point that way. To have invited
eight nations and to have spoken to but two
at the start was a good deal like inviting
eight guests to a dining table and talking
to but two of them through the meal. The
oversight, if that’s the proper word for it,
was forgotten, if noticed by any one in the
really tremendous thing that Mr. Hughes
did. The trouble is that there is almost
always one among a number of neglected
guests that does feel and does not forget
it.</p>

<p class='c019'>The opening week of the Conference kept
France in about the same position that she
had on the opening day. She was not yet
a principal, and another point—and one
that is hard on the French—they saw here
what they began to see in Paris in 1919 and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>so openly resented there—that English is
taking the place of French as the language
of diplomacy. There is no mistake about
this, and I don’t wonder that all Frenchmen
resent it. At the opening day every
delegate, except M. Briand, spoke in English;
the French translations which followed
each speech were made purely out of
compliment to the French delegation. M.
Briand is one of not a few in France who
will take no pains, whatever their contracts,
to learn a word of English. For the last
two years he has been constantly in conference
with Lloyd George, he has had most
of that time the remarkable interpreter, M.
Carmlynck, at his side. I have heard
M. Carmlynck say that in all this time M.
Briand has not learned a word of English,
although Lloyd George, who at the start
understood no French at all, is now able to
follow closely the arguments in French, and
even will at times correct or question the
phrasing of the translation into English.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>The French are not a race that conceal
their feelings. An Englishman, an American,
is apt to accuse anybody who does not
cover up disappointment, resentment, of
being a poor sport. France’s chief contempt
for the Anglo-Saxon is that he is not
out and out with everything; that he has
reticences and reserves, conceals his dislikes,
his vices, his emotions. The French
showed at Washington from the start that
they were disappointed. They did not mix
freely; they did not use the ample offices
prepared for them in the Annex to the Pan-American
Building, where the delegates sat,
although every other nation was making
more or less use of these quarters. They
insisted on conducting all their press meetings
in French alone, although every other
nation, when it put up somebody who did
not speak English, provided a translator.
The result was that the French press gatherings
were sparsely attended.</p>

<p class='c019'>And then came M. Briand’s speech,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>which caused the first Conference crisis.
For days after that speech was made, I listened
to people remake it, giving their idea
of how he might have used the same matter
and carried his audience with him, giving
them the impression of a courageous people,
as they really are, intent not only on
the restoration of their tormented and suffering
land but willing to do their part to
restore the rest of the world. Instead, M.
Briand gave an impression of a land in
panic, its mind centered on possible dangers
from a conquered enemy. It was <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">France
Sanglante</span></i> that he held in upraised arms before
the Conference, a bleeding France at
whom ravening German and Russian wolves
were snapping and threatening. All his
powerful oratory, his wealth of emotional
gesture, upraised arms, tossed black locks,
rolling head, tortured features—all these
M. Briand brought into play in his efforts
to arouse the Conference to share
the fears of France. He could not do it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>He was talking to people as well informed
as himself on the actual facts of Europe,
but people who are not interpreting those
facts in the way that the French do. He
was talking to people who view the situation
of the present world as one to be corrected
only by hard, steady sacrifice and
work in a spirit of good will and mercy.
Unhappily he gave them the impression
that France thought only of herself and of
what the world should do for her to pay her
for her terrible sacrifices. In his picture
of bleeding France he did not include bleeding
Belgium, Italy, England, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, all of whom sat at
the table and all of whom had suffered
losses and are staggering under debts, if
not equal, at least comparable to those of
France.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was a mistake of emphasis, that brilliant
journalist Simeon Strunsky said. He
pointed out that the thing really relevant
in M. Briand’s speech was practically concealed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>from the public, that France had disarmament
plans on hand which soon would
reduce her army one half and her term of
military service from three years to eighteen
months. M. Briand’s tragic picture of
the danger of France so obscured this statement,
so vitally important to the work of
the Conference, that not a few people contended
that no such statement was ever
made. One has only to look at the text of
the address to see that it was there, though
so out of proportion to the bulk of the
speech that it failed of its effect.</p>

<p class='c019'>The speech was disastrous. “I was never
so heartsick in my life,” I heard one of the
greatest and most important men in Washington
say after it was over. Mr. Wells,
that ardent advocate of the brotherhood of
man, knocked his doctrine all to smithereens
by accusing France of wanting arms
to turn against England. Lord Curzon, as
militant as Mr. Wells, made a most unguarded
speech for a man in his position.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>France, sore and sensitive, cried aloud
that the United States and Great Britain
were trying to isolate her. Mr. Hughes
and Mr. Balfour had, to be sure, made consoling
speeches after M. Briand’s outburst,
but they were rather the efforts of serene
elderly friends trying to calm the panic of
a frightened child, and their effect was
rather to aggravate France’s determination
to assert herself, to prove herself the equal,
by arms, if necessary, of any nation in the
world, England included.</p>

<p class='c019'>The irritation of that day spread over the
world. The Conference was “wrecked,”
cried the lovers of gloom and chaos. Washington
buzzed with gossip of wrangling between
even the heads of delegations. There
was a rumor spread of a sharp quarrel between
Mr. Balfour and Mr. Hughes on the
way the discussions in the committees were
to be handled. It was said that Mr. Hughes
wanted everything that was voiced put
down; that Mr. Balfour thought a digest of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>the discussions would be sufficient. This
rumor was followed by the story of an ugly
scene in committee between the French
Premier, Briand, and the Italian Senator
Schanzer over the morals of the Italian
army.</p>

<p class='c019'>Now, luckily the Conference was admirably
arranged to scotch vicious rumors.
There never has been a great international
gathering in which the press had as real an
opportunity to learn what was going on.
Every morning there was given out at press
headquarters a list of delegates who at
fixed hours would receive the press. This
morning bulletin ran something like this:</p>

<table class='table1' summary=''>
  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>11:00</td>
    <td class='c008'>A.M.</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>11:30</td>
    <td class='c008'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c021'>Ambassador Schanzer</td>

    <td class='c021'>Admiral Kato</td>

  <tr>
    <td class='c011'>6:00</td>
    <td class='c008'>&nbsp;</td>
    <td class='c021'>Mr. Balfour</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p class='c019'>and so on. Every day from six to eight opportunities
were given to correspondents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>to question principals of the Conference.
How much they got depended upon how
much they carried—how able they were to
ask questions—how sound their judgment
was of the answers they received—how honest
their intent in interpreting. When ugly
rumors such as those which disturbed the
second week of the Conference’s life occurred,
this method of treating the press
was of real advantage to the powers concerned.
It was a joy to see the way Secretary
Hughes, for instance, handled the
rumors at this moment.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was always a joy to see Mr. Hughes
when he was righteously indignant, and he
certainly was so on the afternoon of November
25. He lunged at once at the report
of the break between himself and Mr. Balfour.
The statement had no basis but the
imagination of the writer. It was unjust
to Mr. Balfour, who had been coöperative
from the start. To put him of all men at
the Conference in a position of opposing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>United States was most unfair. There had
been no clashes in committees, no quarrels.
There had, of course, been differences in
points of view, candid statements, free explanations,
but any one with common sense
knew that such exchange of views must
take place. It was a fine, generous, convincing
answer to the ugly rumors, and the
beauty of it was that you believed Mr.
Hughes. You knew that he was not lying
to you. I believe this to have been the general
conviction of the newspaper men. He
convinced them and they were all for him.
This was a real achievement for any man,
for the press craft are hard to convince and
quick to suspect. Many of them have been
for years in the thick of public affairs,
watching men go up and down; seeing
heroes made and unmade; the incorruptible
prove corruptible. One wonders sometimes
not that they have so little faith, but that
they have any. They believed Mr. Hughes.
When he denied the rumors his word was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>accepted. But the rumors were out, and
had been cabled abroad and were already
doing their ugly work there—fighting right
and left like mad dogs. There was even riot
and bloodshed in Italy over the report that
Briand had spoken lightly of their army.</p>

<p class='c019'>It looked for the moment as if an atmosphere
was gathering around the Washington
Conference similar to that in which
the Paris Conference had done its work.
Indeed, already the observer who had been
in Paris in 1919, had been more than once
startled with the way the two conferences
were beginning to parallel each other. Just
what happened in Paris had already happened
here—a wonderful first stage in which
a noble program had been given out—a program
to which all the world had responded
with joy and hope. Then came a second
stage in which the delegates attempted to
make their noble ideas realities. It was in
this transition period that the first convulsions
of public and press began. They saw
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>that, as a matter of fact, the Conference
had no magic to practice, that it was nothing
but the same old hard effort to work out
by conferring, by bargaining, by compromise,
the best that they could get. And they
saw, too, that most of this work was going
on behind closed doors. The moment that
the Washington Conference attempted to
get down to cases there was the same burst
of remonstrance, suspicion, accusation that
we saw in Paris. “Secret diplomacy.”
Then came rumors of quarrels. If it was
secret, must it not have been because there
were things that they did not want known
outside—breaks in their good will? The
rumors of quarrels were spread with relish,
and often malice. Dislike of this or that
nation flared up, mistrust of this or that
man. Washington air was saturated with
impatience, suspicion, intrigue. Was the
Conference to gather about it the same
storm of wicked passions that had been so
strong in Paris, doing their best to wreck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the work, and frustrating some of the noblest
attempts. That dreadful “outside” of
the Paris Conference, created by the unreason,
hate, vanity and ambitions of men,
seemed about to be duplicated. I had never
set down my impressions of the Paris atmosphere
at the time of the Peace Conference;
I would do it now, that I might have
it to compare with what seemed to me was
about to develop in Washington.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <span class='large'>THE PARIS SHRINE OF OUR LADY OF HATES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Men and women who have been spectators
of great human tussles are generally possessed
by a desire to tell what they saw,
thought and felt during its progress, and
until they have relieved themselves of this
obsession they are uneasy, as from a duty
undone. Until one carries for a time such
an obsession as this he cannot realize the
patness of the vulgar expression getting a
thing “off one’s chest.” It lies there, literally
a load. He may have a notion—and his
delay is probably due to that—that he will
only be adding another folio to a more or
less pestiferous collection; that, as a matter
of fact, he will not, and cannot, communicate
anything that others have not already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>communicated. All he can do is to
say, “So I saw it; so it seemed to me.”</p>

<p class='c019'>For three years I had carried around a
few impressions of the Paris Conference of
1919. I had meant to keep them to myself—they
were so ungracious. Summed up
they amounted to a melancholy conclusion
that in times of stress, public and press,
unrestrained, make a bedlam in which
steady constructive effort, if not frustrated
utterly, is sure to be hindered and distorted.
Taken as a whole the <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">milieu</span></i> in which the
Paris Conference operated, furnished the
most perfect example the world has ever
seen of the arrogance of the one who calls
himself liberal, of the irresponsibility of
him who calls himself radical, of the unutterable
stupidity of him who calls himself
conservative, of the universal habit of saving
your face by crying down what others
are attempting to do, and of the limitations
which the laws of human nature and
human society put upon the collective efforts
of human beings.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>From the day that the Conference opened
you had the impression of each man—I am
talking here only of the man on the outside—being
for himself in what was plainly
and admittedly the world’s most gigantic
effort to sink this each man in the whole.
It was the insistence of the individual and
his way of thinking, so long held in check
by the terrific necessities of the war, that
caused the first doubts of the undertaking
to one who struggled to keep a disinterested
outlook. Take the idealists who had
accepted the great formula for world peace
laid down; they regarded it as something
accomplished because for the moment it
stood out as the clear desire of the world,
and were heedless and contemptuous of the
wisest words that were uttered at the start,
the words of Georges Clemenceau, who, at
the first session, told the delegates of all
the nations of the world that if this daring
thing, which he doubted but to which he
consented, went through it meant sacrifice
for everybody. But your idealist had not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>come for sacrifice. He had come to put into
operation his particular formula for a perfect
world.</p>

<p class='c019'>With every day the numbers in Paris
grew who had come to help—to get a hearing—to
help in the group at the top—to be
heard by principals. They failed. Disappointment,
wounded vanity, the sense that
they were somebody, had something to contribute,
stirred them to resentment. They
would serve, and they were rejected. There
was, to be sure, one thing that those who
resented this apparent unconsciousness of
their importance by those charged with the
conduct of things might have done—one
surely useful thing, and that was, casting
an eye about and seeing the multitude of
problems that shrieked for solution, master
one, little as it might be:—the case of
Teschen, of the Banat of Tamesvar, the history
of a boundary, the need of a coal mine
here or there—and working, really working,
on this particular problem, produce some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>sound presentation, something that men
could not get around. The whole bubbling
pot of trouble called for such cooling drops
of real, carefully considered work.</p>

<p class='c019'>But this demanded self-direction, poise, a
willingness to make a very small contribution,
to have no pretense of being called
into council, to trust to the gods and your
own knowledge of what really counts in
solving complications. It called for going
aside, of not pretending to be on the inside.
Minds were too troubled, vanity was
too keen. You eased your mind and poulticed
your vanity by talk—talk at dinner
tables, over restaurant coffee, over tea—and
talk in endless articles.</p>

<p class='c019'>One of the banes of the Paris Peace Conference
was that there were so many men
and women on the field under contract to
write, to produce so many words every day
or every week. There was no contract that
these words should add something to the
knowledge of the many things about which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>it was so necessary for men and women to
learn—no contract that they should contribute
by ever so little to the great need
of control on every side, that they should
comfort, soften hates, stimulate common
sense. Writers covered up their ignorance
of things doing by prophecies, by shrieks of
despair, by poses of intimacy with the
great, by elaborately spun-out theories.
And they built up superstitions. They
created things—absolutely created superstitions
that may never be dispelled from the
minds of those who read them back home.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was the superstition of the mysterious
four who, without advice, without
use of the vast machinery of expert knowledge
that had been called into existence,
without consideration of political prejudice,
of ancient hates and struggles, carved up
countries, made artificial boundaries, and
did it with a nicely calculated sense of revenge,
hate, self-advantage. This “Big-Four”
came in popular minds to be a hydra-headed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>tyrant—more irresponsible, brutal,
and cynical than any czar of Russia or
Machiavelli of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='c019'>And it was a creation that left out of consideration
facts that were there for everybody
to read if they were willing to work.
It was a Putois they created. Who was
Putois? Read your Anatole France, or if
Crainquebille is not at hand, read Joseph
Conrad’s review.</p>

<p class='c019'>The malevolence of those not charged
with the conduct of affairs against those so
charged grew thicker and thicker as the days
went on. Gossip became more and more unrestrained.
It was the only refuge of the
numbers who had no definite business in the
scene but who had come to watch—often
with the idea in their minds that they might
be able to contribute some definite, salutary,
stimulating something, often again with a
very definite idea that they might be able
to pull down this or that person having some
actual inside hold.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>There were those who set themselves with
calculation to destroy the prestige of the
President of the United States; not to destroy
it by sound criticism of his point of
view, by the presentation of a larger aspect
of things than his, but to do it by a calculated
meanness of mind. In the general and
frightful disorder left by the war, everything
begged that men should sink their
littleness and show bigness, if there was
any in them, or if not leave the scene, in
order at least, by their absence, there might
be so much less of littleness of mind around.
But these men—and women—stayed on.
They sat at the tables of the Ritz and
smacked their lips over a nasty piece of
scandal, born of mischief-making partisans
in far distant places; the meanness of the
“outs” against the leader of the “ins.” And
there were always those to listen and to
spread.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the greatness of the calamity that had
overwhelmed the world, it would seem that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>men should have gone beyond the point not
only of this wanton mischief but beyond
the point of sneering. A sneer in the face
of this vast destruction of mankind was like
a sneer at an angry Jehovah. But men
everywhere sneered at the attempts at order,
at justice. And, curiously enough, it was
those who labeled themselves liberal, humane,
that sneered most.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was a despairing consciousness at
times that in every heart some unextinguishable
hatred was nourished. There were the
hatreds against those who did not believe
with you. You began to see growing in
Paris among Americans what we have seen
growing here at home since the war—the
revival of that old, old hate of England.
What hope is there of the world, one felt
sometimes like asking, when some man or
woman who literally had given his life to
good works or good causes poured a vial
of vitriol on the English nation? It took
you back to the Civil War, and the delivery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>up to England, by the wisdom of Abraham
Lincoln, of the Confederate commissioners.
Owen Lovejoy, lifelong friend of human
freedom, enemy of human slavery, rose in
the Congress of the United States then and
swore, so that all the country heard, his
own undying hatred of England.</p>

<p class='c019'>What was the world problem, after all,
but to extinguish hatred?</p>

<p class='c019'>Unless that hymn of hate could be silenced,
what hope was there of peace, order,
or the forms of order? And yet the advocates
of peace fed the fires in their own
hearts and did their best to enkindle them
in others.</p>

<p class='c019'>And it was not alone American hatred of
England, French hatred of Germany, or
English hatred of Germany that you heard
of, but new hates. They ran about like fire
maniacs, pouring oil on old factional, national
and international troubles,—the
Egyptian against the English, the Greek
against the Turk—the Pole against the
Russian.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>There used to stand in Brittany one of
those frank, realistic shrines that the Gallic—honest
with the ways of his own heart—so
often sets up, a statue to Notre Dame des
Haines-Our Lady of the Hates. A mob
from all over the earth flocked to Paris, carrying
under their arms big or little replicas
of Notre Dame des Haines—intent on rearing
them at the doors of the Conference.</p>

<p class='c019'>Savage instincts came to the top, and no
contradiction, in all this sea of contradiction,
stared at you more hatefully than that
of announced pacifists lending all their efforts
to a May Day riot, almost panting to
see blood run, and perching themselves on
possible vantage points, to cheer on any
possible disorder at a time when tormented
authorities had ordered the public to stay
indoors, and had taken taxis and omnibuses
from the streets. They wanted the
protest of blood against what? As nearly
as one could see, it was against the only
organized widespread effort then making in
the tormented world to bring the peace and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>justice which they had made it their professional
business to preach.</p>

<p class='c019'>A despairing fact was that individuals
and groups, whose profession in life it had
been to be auxiliaries of peace and order,
became auxiliaries of war and disorder.
There was one way of counteracting their
power, and that was using them, putting it
up to them as Mr. Lincoln put it up to
Horace Greeley in 1864.</p>

<p class='c019'>To put it up to them in the way of the
Niagara Conference—that was the real wisdom,
the real wisdom of the leader always
toward protesting groups—let them try
their hand. Possibly they can pull it
through, contribute something which he and
those of his type cannot do. But in this
avalanche of demands—causes, old and new;
injustices running back to the Flood; with
a hundred unsolvable problems for every
hour—how place all this pestiferous mob
that knew how to do it? It was to bale out
the Seine with a teaspoon—a vaster river
than the Potomac and a smaller teaspoon.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>And the trying came so often to naught.
There was Prinkipo—modeled on the real
idealist’s formula, sound enough for a limited
scene, with a limited cast—“get together
around a table and talk it over.”</p>

<p class='c019'>But the table? How find it in this still
seething land over so much of which the
lava was still hot and uncrossable, with
so many craters where at every instant new
eruptions threatened. They tried it—went
into the sea for their table, at a spot of
which some of those who chose it had never
heard, and to which one at least objected—soundly
enough—because the name sounded
so like the name of a comic opera.</p>

<p class='c019'>And the table selected, how get contestants
there? In this Europe they were remaking,
such was the physical, military and
political hampering that there was no spot
to which it was certain that everybody could
reach. And, as in the Prinkipo case, you
ran up against things more unyielding than
armies or parties—that hardening of will,
that deadening of the spirit of coöperation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>which is one of the most terrible works of
revolutions—something happening to men
who have all their lives been good men, devoted
to the end of human happiness, freezing
them until they will no longer work
with other men to bring order and peace to
a tormented land for which they have always
slaved.</p>

<p class='c019'>To sit at a table and hear a great noble,
white-bearded advocate of human rights,
turned to bitterness and scorn of those who
have ruined his plan of doing things but
who, for the moment, are in the saddle,
carrying out their own violent, fanatic way,
refuse to even meet at the Prinkipo table
the representative of those advocates of violence
in order to attempt to somehow soften
their madness—you know then that you
have reached a human limit, a limit to the
human being’s capacity to face those who
disagree and those whom he despises though
in that meeting there may be a remote,
though ever so remote, chance to stay a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>murderous hand and soften a murderous
spirit.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was not only such curious impressions
of the limitations of the human mind one
received, but of the human heart as well.
It seemed as if it were not big enough—even
in the case of those whose profession
it is to be humane—not big enough to cover
anything but some special group whose
cause they espoused. There were many disheartening
exhibits of this limitation. One
that will always stick in my mind as one of
the most hideous was the tears of a great
humanitarian over the German prisoner in
France—a prisoner at that time receiving
the same rations and even better shelter
and more clothes than most French refugees,
and an absolute setting of lips and hardness
of eyes at the mention of children and
women in the caves of Lens, the shattered
ruins of Peronne—it was not humanity but
an espoused group of humanity that stirred
his sympathy.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>Limits to human endurance, human capacity,
human kindness, human foresight—that
was what every day of the Peace Conference
cried louder and louder into your
ear.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <span class='large'>WHY DID HE DO IT?</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>But Washington was not to parallel
Paris. The uproar caused by M. Briand’s
speech died away in an amazingly short
time—so far as Washington was concerned.
The violence and indiscretions of the press
to which so much of the disturbance on the
other side of the Atlantic was due was not
followed up. Those that had been responsible
were all of them, I think, a little
ashamed, though Mr. Wells obstinately came
back once<a id='t99'></a> or twice to tell what he thought of
the French. Explanations quieted the Italians.
M. Briand had never used the offensive
word attributed to him, it had been but
a mistake of the cables—and a serious mistake,
it should be said, too, of the journalist
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>that had cabled it without verification.
On all sides lectures were read to the correspondents.
Go on this way and they could
easily wreck the whole thing. Go on this
way and peace never at any time could be
made in the world. Any effort of man could
be easily upset if passionate judgments and
unconfirmed suspicions were to be sent
broadcast through the newspapers. People
believe what they read, unhappily, and
have little or no way of verifying. There
was much of this reproving talk going on
and some of those who handled it most vigorously
belonged to the Washington press.
It had its effect at once.</p>

<p class='c019'>Then, too, it was hard to be continuously
violent and suspicious in Washington. The
lovely days, the wide streets, the freedom
from the turmoil of business and industry,
the very absence of exciting night life—all
tended to calm the spirit. How different
from Paris in 1919! There one lived in a
city encircled by vast hospitals where thousands
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>upon thousands of shattered men
tossed on their beds of pain. Soldiers of all
nations swarmed everywhere. In many
streets of the city the shops were still sealed
up. On all sides one found great staring
gaps—the wounds of the city made by the
shells of Big Bertha or the nightly visits of
airplanes. Everywhere you went you saw
still the signs “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abri</span></i>” (shelter), vividly recalling
the long years in which no man safely
went out without knowing that there was
a refuge near by. The streets at night were
still dark, and those within still tightened
their shutters and drew close their curtains,
unable to believe that light was no longer
a danger.</p>

<p class='c019'>You rode in battered taxicabs over streets
that were rough from long inattention. In
every house you entered the marks of war
still remained. Nothing had been mended
or repaired in Paris for five years. A heating
apparatus out of order, it stayed out of
order. A window broken, it stayed broken.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>A hinge off, it stayed off. Carpets and
furniture went uncleaned. And in the
homes of the rich where there had been beautiful
pictures, empty frames hung on the
wall, the canvas having been cut out and
sent to some place of safety. There was
no color. All Paris was in black. Even in
the windows of the shops you saw nothing
but black. Your dressmaker and milliner
had no heart to work in colors, it still to
them was bad taste. It was only the influx
and the demand of the visiting foreigners,
who multiplied as the Conference went
on, that brought back colors to the shop
windows.</p>

<p class='c019'>What a contrast to all this was Washington
in the fall of 1921, with its gayety and
lavishness, its incessant round of lunches
and teas and dinners, its over-weighted
tables, unbelievable in their abundance to
the visiting strangers, so long—and still—on
stricter rations. You could not be tragic
long in Washington.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Then there was Mr. Hughes’ steady hand.
He laughed daily at his press conferences
at the insinuations and solemnity of the
questioning press correspondents. Everything
was going on swimmingly, he asserted.
“Excellent progress.” The naval committee
was at work, the Far Eastern committee
had begun its sessions, the agenda would
be followed step by step, but one thing at
a time would be attempted; when they had
finished what they were at now they would
take up the next step, and not before. It
was certainly steadying, if not exciting. It
gave confidence, if not headlines. All of this
quieted the storm, but it was left to the
President of the United States to sweep it
entirely from the Conference sky, though
whether he did it intentionally or accidentally
is still, I think, an unanswered
question.</p>

<p class='c019'>Why did President Harding, without
warning, inject an Association of Nations
into the Conference on the Limitation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Armament, on the last day of its second
week of life? The Conference had a definite
agenda. Mr. Hughes, its chairman, was following
it with the rigor of a good schoolmaster.
That agenda made no mention of
a conference, association or league of nations.
So far as it was concerned, the world
war is made up of nine nations. And here
came the President of the United States
and casually announced that before the
work was completed it should include an
association of all the nations of the earth.</p>

<p class='c019'>Why did he do it? Did he want to divert
public attention from the dangerous irritations
of the moment? We do not yet know
enough of the workings of Mr. Harding’s
mind to be able to say whether he would,
like Napoleon III, gild a dome when there
was squally public weather. All we do
really know about the President, so far, is
his genuinely beneficent intent. Is he canny
enough to know that the public is as easily
diverted as a child and capable of attempting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>the trick when things are getting a
bit out of hand?</p>

<p class='c019'>Whether this is true or not, he certainly
put an end to the ticklish situation in which
the Conference found itself in Thanksgiving
week. Everybody fell to discussing the
proposition. Was the Conference really to
end up in an Association of Nations? Did
this mean that the United States would
suggest to the delegates gathered at the
Conference—all of them members of the
League of Nations—that they scrap that institution?
There had been much speculation
in Geneva before the Washington Conference
was called as to whether the intention
was to force the League out of existence.
So great was the anxiety of more than one
European country to be in any congregation
in which the United States figured,
that it was pretty generally agreed that if
such a proposition should be made it would
be assented to. Was this Mr. Harding’s
first feeler then toward substituting something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>of his own for the League? But this
was only a speculation. Nobody could get
from any official source any confirmation
that Mr. Harding had anything definite in
mind. And yet they were not unwilling to
accept the notion that he had inadvertently
thrown out so important a suggestion.</p>

<p class='c019'>There were those who had an unamiable
explanation. We are all human, they said.
We must remember that this has ceased to
be Mr. Harding’s conference. His fine sentiments
on Armistice Day on the opening of
the Conference had been greeted with loud
acclaim the world over. But after he had
opened the Conference he left the hall.
Secretary Hughes appeared, and it was Secretary
Hughes who stirred the world.
From that time on, the Secretary had been
the one man quoted. We have had great
secretaries—Mr. Root, for instance, who
never allowed his shadow to fall across that
of the President of the United States.
When Mr. Roosevelt was President, Mr.
Root prepared some very remarkable state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>papers, but they always began “The President
instructs me to say.” Mr. Hughes
has been speaking for himself. It is quite
possible, said these interpreters, that the
President thinks the time has come to let
the public know that, after all, it is he who
occupies the White House.</p>

<p class='c019'>I am quite sure that if this had been true,
we should have had other evidence of it
as time went on, but none came. Mr. Harding
knew well enough that a successful Conference
was in the long run his triumph.
He knew well enough that the only man who
could give him this success was Secretary
Hughes. Possibly the wisest thing that Mr.
Harding has yet done as President has been
to let the members of his cabinet do their
own work. Jealousy is not, I am sure, an
explanation of Mr. Harding’s sudden introduction
of an Association of Nations into
the Conference on the Limitation of Armament.
Was it to be found in M. Briand’s
speech?</p>

<p class='c019'>M. Briand did not convince his audience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>as we have seen. That is, he did not
bring it to the point at which he was aiming.
But one thing that he did do was to
bring into sharp relief the fact that land
and naval armaments cannot be handled
separately. They dovetail in the game of
war, are mutually defensive and offensive;
to cut the navy of a nation whose main
defense is ships, without considering the
relation of that cut to the size of the armies
of those nations in which armies are the
chief defense, is to leave an unbalanced
situation.</p>

<p class='c019'>A second realization went along with this,
and that was that the scrapping and cutting
by nine nations must be done with an eye
to the actual or potential naval armaments
of the other forty-five or so nations of the
earth. Senator Schanzer had already suggested
this in his speech made on November
15, accepting in principle for Italy the naval
program. “I think it rather difficult,” he
said, “to separate the question of Italian
and French naval armament limitation from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the general question of naval armaments of
the world.”</p>

<p class='c019'>M. Briand’s speech made one realize how
France and Italy must consider possible
continental alliances of powers that were
not represented at this Conference; must
consider a possible Russian crusade to convert
the world by force to its gospel. And
if France and Italy must, or thought they
must, secure themselves against these possibilities,
could England weaken herself disproportionately?
When you began to consider
the question of armament in terms of
the world and not simply of nine nations,
you could not if you were candid find any
peaceful solution but by bringing everybody
in—Germany, Turkey, Russia. Now it may
be, though we do not know Mr. Harding
well enough yet to say, that the logic of
the experiences that the Conference had
been through up to date laid hold of him
and he said it like a man—“there is but one
way out, and that is by One Big Union.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Of course there is another explanation of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>why he did it and I rather think it may be
the true one, after all. The President may
have been hearing from the country. One
thing that we do know about him is that he
is a man who with almost religious care listens
to the voices that come up to him from
the people. And it was no secret that a
multitude of them, strong and weak, had
been calling to him in the weeks preceding—“conference,”
“association,” “league,”
“some method of carrying on in which everybody
can join,” “in no other way can we
hope for permanent peace.” It may be that
Mr. Harding had heard so much of this that
he felt he must reply. And if this was true,
he did wisely.</p>

<p class='c019'>We may lay it down as one of the great
facts of the present international state of
mind, that the world is intent on some sort
of an association of nations. It is not set,
so far as one can determine, on any particular
covenant, though of course there is one
to which some fifty nations of the world
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>have subscribed and in which for some two
years now they have been doing increasingly
practical work in adjusting difficulties between
nations. The very fact that the
League of Nations lives—the divers ways
in which its adventures in world unionism
come to us—only makes the idea of association
stronger in the minds of the peoples of
the earth.</p>

<p class='c019'>The Conference might limit armaments,
naval and land, in the nine nations that
were here gathered. It might make settlements
of the Far Eastern questions, but
there still would remain the rest of the
world. It is a part of things. The world
is one. It has come to a consciousness of
its oneness. Nothing can dull that consciousness,
stop the determination to realize
it. Not Mr. Borah, not Mr. Lodge.
Somehow we have got to learn to come together
and stay together. Walt Whitman
once said of Abraham Lincoln’s passion for
the Union that unionism had become “a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>new virtue” with him,—a virtue like honesty,
goodness, truthfulness. There is no
manner of doubt that in the minds of this
world unionism is coming to be regarded as
a virtue; that the demand for its realization
as the only road to world peace is becoming
more and more universal.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Harding may have seen this. He may
have gone over in his mind the steps that
in the last twenty-five years—not to go back
farther—the world has taken toward this—the
steps at the Hague, the various peace
conferences, the greatest of all experiments
now making at Geneva—and he may have
seen that he could no longer deny the demand
of this people that he take another
step toward the realization of this great
hope. Whatever the reason, however, of
his unexpected suggestion, it served the
excellent purpose of turning the mind of
the public to the fact that however complete
the work of the Conference might be there
would still be more to do if the world was
to remain at peace.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>In the meantime the Conference itself was
going steadily ahead. Everybody seemed
cheerful. Everybody was cheerful. If the
Conference had rocked on its base for a moment,
it had come back to its position; and
it was obvious enough, too, from all that
one heard and saw, that there was going
soon to be something definite and important
to announce as a result of the work that
was going on.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <span class='large'>DRAMATIC DIPLOMACY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>Who was the dramatist of the Conference
on the Limitation of Armament? Mr.
Hughes? I would never have believed it.
I could never have conceived of his deliberately
staging his diplomatic achievements
with an appreciation of the time, the place
and the world at large which was really
amazing. It did not need Mr. Balfour’s delicate
and humorous understanding to point
out to those who were present at the opening
on November 12 that the dramatic quality
of Mr. Hughes’ great speech rivaled, if
it did not outstrip, its splendid matter. But
who would have believed that he would repeat
himself? Yet he did it. Just four
weeks from his first great coup he pulled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>off another that had every element of drama
which characterized the first—and it had
more—strains of genuine emotion and one
scene of biting satire. (Not for a moment,
however, do I believe that Mr. Hughes intended
<em>that</em>.)</p>

<p class='c019'>The surprise of the opening day of the
Conference, November 12, lay in the unexpectedness
of what Mr. Hughes had to say.
The first surprise, of December 10, lay in
the fact that there was to be a full session.
It was not until nearly midnight of the 9th
that it was announced. A few diners lingering
late heard of it. The press of course
was informed. But to most of us the news
came when we opened our morning paper
over our coffee—a full headline across the
top of the page—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div>PLENARY SESSION TO-DAY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>Of course we realized that it was going to
be a big day. For days there had been hidden
in the mists about the Conference something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>which those who were able to penetrate
near to the center of things declared
to be a treaty. Watching this treaty emerge
was like watching a ship come out of a
thick fog. There were warning signals,
faint at first, but growing more and more
distinct—the Anglo-Japanese pact was dying.
If the United States wished it, it
should go; and it was certain that the
United States had for a long time wished
it,—also Australia and other parts of the
British Empire. Then we began to hear
more and more from another direction—signals
that had been sounded at intervals
for weeks before the Conference convened.
Japan was uneasy about the naval bases in
the Pacific. She would like to have them
dismantled. As one listened one began to
understand that Mr. Hughes’ program of
naval limitation would stay where it was
until something had been done about both
the Anglo-Japanese Pact and the Islands of
the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>The logic of the situation began to be
clear. The fair-minded began to ask themselves,
“Well, now, after all, how can we
expect Japan to strip herself of ships, if
she must, as seems to be inevitable, give
up her understanding with England? How
can we expect her to weaken her defenses
and take no exception to the fortifications
in the waters near her? She is the member
of this Conference that is being asked to
sacrifice until it hurts, and the only one.
Is it fair to ask her to sacrifice without
guarantees? Is there any way out but a
treaty—a treaty in which we join?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Moreover, if you ask her to sacrifice without
a guarantee, will she do it? Not Japan.
Thus it became more and more clear that
the success of the naval program depended
on some kind of a pact which would satisfy
Japan that she could agree to what Mr.
Hughes had asked and still have no reason
to feel herself in danger.</p>

<p class='c019'>The first definite black-faced, full-width-of-the-page
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>headline came, as I remember,
on December 5—“Four Power Entente to
Replace Anglo-Japanese Alliance.” The
morning after this bold announcement it
was not quite so sure. The newspapers
were keeping a line of retreat open. As
they now put it: “Discussions of the proposals
have reached a well-advanced stage,”
none of the governments concerned had
given final approval. There was enough
that was sure, however, to give the wicked
a chance to jeer at approaching “entangling
alliances.”</p>

<p class='c019'>By Friday, December 9, the most careful
journals were saying, on what they declared
to be the best sort of authority, that the
United States was going into a pact with
Japan and England and France, guaranteeing
various things. There was considerable
diversity in the assertions about what it
guaranteed. Washington said nothing. The
news came from all of the capitals of the
powers concerned, except our own. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>evidently very hard for Washington to say
“treaty.”</p>

<p class='c019'>There was much entertaining gossip running
around as to how Tokyo and London
and Paris had been able to give the press
the news of what was going to be done, while
Washington was silent. One story was that
a clever Japanese journalist had managed
to get a glimpse of the document in preparation
and had cabled what he had been able
to make out of its contents to Tokyo; that
from there it had gone to Paris and London
and finally came here. That was one story.
Another was a rather thin version of that
old, old device of writers of diplomatic
fiction—a lively and lovely lady lunches
with an elderly diplomat, who, to win her
favor, reveals the secret that is in the air.
That evening she dines with a young journalist
whom she naturally (and necessarily
for the purpose of the plot) much prefers,
and to prove her devotion she tells him what
her elder suitor has revealed. Threadbare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>as the formula is, it was honored the week
that the treaty was coming out of the fog
by at least one important newspaper.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Hughes seems to have concluded by
the end of Friday, the 9th, that unless he
acted quickly his reputation for dramatic
diplomacy might be shaken, and so the
hasty summons, the thrill at the breakfast
table, the quick readjustments of plans,
the rush to make sure that your credentials
were all right and your ticket waiting you.</p>

<p class='c019'>From the beginning of the Conference,
sun and air were in league with those who
were staging it with such a sense of dramatic
values. Never was there a morning
of lovelier tenderness than that on which
they carried the Unknown Soldier to his
grave; Mr. Hughes’ big gun was fired under
a perfect morning sky—it was only when
we came out that things had grown stern
and the clouds were dark, as if to give
us a sense that a serious thing had been done
that morning and it was well to get down to
work, if it was to be made good.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>The morning of December 10 there was
frost on all the Washington roof tops, the
sky was clear, there was an air that put a
spring in your heels and it was a joy to
hurry down with the crowd to get your
ticket; it put you in mood for something
exciting, helped enormously the keen anticipation
that stirred the town.</p>

<p class='c019'>The scene in the Conference was what it
had been at the three previous open sessions:
each delegate in his place, the advisory
board banked behind them, the boxes
overflowing with ladies, the press in their
usual seats, the House gallery even more
amusing than on the opening day. It was
quite full, for somehow the House had obtained
permission to bring its family along,
and there were many ladies sprinkled
through the gallery. They made it more
animated but not a whit more dignified in
its behavior.</p>

<p class='c019'>And then, on the tick of the hour, Mr.
Hughes arose. What an orderly mind! A
mind that must know where it is headed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>how it is going to get there, the exact point
it has reached at the given moment! He
must know himself, and he never fails, when
he presents his case, to make sure that you
know. Again and again in his talks to the
press he would carefully point out to the
correspondents who were given to jumping
to the future, running back to the past,
wanting to know this or that that was not on
the agenda by any stretch of the imagination,
just what “the muttons” were in this
particular Conference. “The agenda is our
chart, here is where we have arrived to-day.
We are moving in this or that direction.
I shall have nothing to say about
what we find when we arrive until we are
there, then you shall know everything.”
That is, Mr. Hughes did his utmost to keep
the mind of press and public concentrated
on the actual problem under his hand. He
started the Plenary Conference of December
10 in the same fashion.</p>

<p class='c019'>The session, he said, was to be devoted to
that part of the agenda which concerned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>itself with the Pacific and Far Eastern questions.
The committee charged with these
questions had taken up first a consideration
of China; certain conclusions in regard to
China already given out to the public had
been reached. It was the business of the
full Conference, however, to assent to these
conclusions. In turn, Mr. Hughes reviewed
them, and in turn the Conference assented
to them:</p>

<p class='c014'>(1) The four resolutions which will go down in
history as the Root resolutions; they are, as Mr.
Hughes pointed out eloquently, a charter given
China by the eight powers at this Conference, protecting
her sovereignty and independence and guaranteeing
that no one hereafter shall seek within
China special advantages at the expense of the rights
of others.</p>

<p class='c014'>(2) The agreement between powers not to conclude
between themselves any treaty affecting China
without previously notifying China and giving her
an opportunity to participate.</p>

<p class='c014'>(3) A pledge given by all the members of the
Conference not to enter into any treaty or understanding
either with one another or with any power
which would infringe the principles laid down in
the Root resolutions.</p>

<p class='c019'>This business done, Mr. Hughes sprang
the second surprise of the day:</p>

<p class='c014'>“I shall now ask Senator Lodge to make a communication
to the Conference with respect to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>matter which is not strictly within the agenda, but
which should be made known to the Conference at
this first opportunity.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It was the treaty that had been lurking
so long behind the fog. A simple enough
treaty in form, brief, only 196 words, but
how portentous for us, the United States.
Those few words bind us to Great Britain,
the French Republic, the Empire of Japan
in a contract to respect one another’s rights
in relation to all insular possessions and
dominions in the region of the Pacific Ocean.
We agree to settle quarrels, if any there
should be, by conference, when it cannot be
done by diplomacy. We agree also if the
rights of any one of the four associates are
threatened from the outside “to communicate
with one another fully and frankly as
to the most efficient measures to be taken
jointly and separately to meet the exigencies
of the particular situation.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Article X of the League of Nations! I
pinched myself to be sure I was not asleep.
Swift glances right and left reassured me,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>for I could see sly little smiles—and some
looks of disgust—on near-by faces. And
then I fixed my eyes on the American delegation.
They were taking it like gentlemen,
though it did seem to me that Mr.
Hughes was not sitting quite so straight
and looking quite so proud as usual. Article
X read by Henry Cabot Lodge! Was the
dramatist for the Conference for the Limitation
of Armament also a great satirist?
Surely you must search far in American
history to find another scene so full of
irony.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Lodge read the treaty through in his
fine, clear voice; digested it in a few simple
words; followed it with a nice little literary
talk on the romance that hangs over
the isles of the Pacific, which we were protecting
from all future aggressors; said
some hard things about war, quite justified—but
I was incapacitated for appreciating
his eloquence, for all I could see was the
United States climbing into the League of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Nations through the pantry window, while
Senator Lodge held up the sash.</p>

<p class='c019'>But it was a fine climb for the United
States!</p>

<p class='c019'>In the week thus opened there followed
more agreements, more settlements,—all
necessary to round out the Four Power
Pact. These were presented to the public
not in open sessions of the Conference but
through the press in what might be called
private rehearsals. Standing at one end of
the long audience room, opening from his
own office in the State Department, a hundred
or more newspaper folk of various nationalities,
pressing close to him, Secretary
Hughes read on Monday afternoon, December
12, the text of an arrangement
with Japan concerning Yap, an arrangement
hanging since last June and now settled
and settled rightly by a fair give and
take on both sides.</p>

<p class='c019'>He followed this by reading the written
consent of the United States to another
chunk of the League of Nations. What it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>amounted to was that the United States
agreed to the mandate given Japan by the
Versailles Treaty over the islands in the
Pacific north of the equator, late the property
of Germany. The United States also
accepted all the terms of the mandate as
laid down by the League of Nations. Excellent
terms they are, too. We are even
to get a copy of the annual report of her
stewardship which Japan, like all other
League mandatories, is obliged to make,
showing that she is really developing and
not exploiting the territory which she is
being allowed to administer. This was a
good deal for one day!</p>

<p class='c019'>What did it mean? Why, most important
of all, that the delegates of the United States
had seen that limitation of armament means
sacrifice. It was unwillingness to sacrifice
that had prevented the disarmament proposed
at Paris.</p>

<p class='c019'>England must have her navy; her security
required it.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>France and Italy must have their armies;
their security required it.</p>

<p class='c019'>Each one of the little new nations that
one would have supposed to have been so
fed up on war that they never again would
have been willing to spend a dollar on a
soldier, must have their armies; their security
required it.</p>

<p class='c019'>Japan must have her army, her navy, her
war loot; her security required it.</p>

<p class='c019'>That is, no one of the allied nations was
ready to make a sacrifice to carry out the
plank of disarmament they had adopted.
They insisted on applying the plank to the
enemy they had beaten, but not to themselves.
This was not in any large degree
because of greed or revenge, it was because
of fear—fear of the vanquished. There was
utter lack of confidence in the plan of peaceful
international coöperation which they
had written into their program. Force
alone spelt security in their minds. They
had no sense of safety in a mere covenant,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>though all the nations of the world did
commit themselves to its provisions.</p>

<p class='c019'>It has been our boast that we alone asked
nothing at Paris. But was this true?
When it came to working out the code which
the world had acclaimed as the true path
to permanent peace, we refused to accept
the one point on which all the rest hung;
that for an association of nations looking
to the continuous peaceful handling of international
difficulties. Such an association
we saw would invade our isolation and
that isolation we have come to believe to be
our chief security. That is, in essence, the
United States was no more willing to make
a sacrifice for permanent peace than were
the distracted and disheveled nations of
Europe. We and they all held on to the
particular device which we had come by
national experience to believe essential to
safety—England her navy, France her army,
Japan her army and her navy, we our freedom
from entangling alliances.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>The Four Power Pact proved that we
were willing to sacrifice something of our
isolation—just how much the future would
have to show. But would we be willing to
sacrifice anything of our naval program?
There had been rumors of changes asked by
both England and Japan. The ugliest gesture
seen in Washington in the early days of
the Conference had greeted these rumors.
We were not going to tolerate tampering
with the great work. It must be accepted as
it was laid down, and if it was not, we would
build the biggest navy on earth; we had the
money; moreover we would call our foreign
loans and then we’d see!</p>

<p class='c019'>Various rumors of objections to the naval
program, now that it had gone to the committee
for detailed examination, were said
to have been made. There was a disturbing
rumor that England wanted the submarine
banished from the navies of the
world, and that we flatly refused to consider
a request which could not but be welcome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>to the mass of the country, anxious to
see not only capital ships scrapped, as had
been proposed on the opening day, but auxiliary
craft of all sorts. The chief irritation,
however, had been over Japan’s strenuous
objection to doing away with the greatest
of her ships—indeed, the greatest ship
afloat, the <em>Mutsu</em>. It was just what we
might have expected of Japan; her acceptation
of the program at the opening of the
Conference was a pretense. She was going
to object at every point. What the public
was still not realizing in regard to the
<em>Mutsu</em> was that to Japan it had become a
tremendous, almost sacred, symbol. It was
a ship designed entirely by the Japanese
naval architects, built of materials prepared
by Japanese workmen, named for a beloved
emperor. The delegation feared to consent
to her destruction. So much national pride
had been aroused by the great ship that to
consent to her destruction might ruin the
whole naval program with Japan.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>It was hard for Americans to understand
any such feeling as this. We have little or
no sentiment about any ship, big or little.
They mean nothing to us but taxes. We
don’t depend upon battleships for safety as
an island nation does. There is Japan,
a little land all told, Formosa and Korea
included, not as large as the state of Texas,
with a sea front of over 18,000 miles. Ships
mean food, contacts, security to her. When
we asked her to sacrifice them we must
remember that we were asking much more
of her than we were of ourselves though our
ratio might have been larger. We must remember
the world is not ruled simply by
tons of material. Symbols weigh more with
nations than tonnage. We could give up
our ships without a sigh; but when Japan
scrapped hers, something of her heart went
with the scrapping.</p>

<p class='c019'>So far as the <em>Mutsu</em> was concerned, the
answer came three days after the agreement
over Yap and the Caroline Islands had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>been made public. On the 15th of December,
at six o’clock in the evening, Mr. Hughes
staged one of his private rehearsals for the
press. It was the decision as to the capital-ship
ratio which had been so long expected
and which had been settled on the basis that
had been proposed on November 12—5–5–3.
But, while the ratio had been kept, the details
had been changed. Great Britain and
the United States had had the good will
and the wisdom to recognize that Japan’s
feeling about the <em>Mutsu</em> was genuine.</p>

<p class='c019'>One has only to read the revised agreement
to understand what pains the two
countries took to readjust the calculations
of the United States in such a way that the
desired ratio would be preserved and
Japan’s pride and sentiment saved. When
nations come to the point that they are willing
to try to understand and to consider
one another’s feelings as well as one another’s
force, there is some hope for the
peace of the world.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>There was no gainsaying the fact that the
great triumph of this dramatic week was
Japan’s. It was a legitimate triumph, honestly
won. She understood what she gained.
As the session of December 10 broke up, one
of the ablest members of her delegation—a
bitter critic of what had been doing—came
out from the Conference hall with tears in
his eyes, though they do say that no Japanese
knows how to shed tears. “It is the
greatest day in the history of the new
world,” he said. And that was true,—if
Japan would now be as generous toward
the rights and aspirations of her great
neighbor China as she had been tenacious
of her own safety and dignity. The world
had recognized her power and her diplomatic
skill. Would she now win its confidence
in her moral integrity?</p>

<p class='c019'>But if December 10 was the beginning of
Japan’s week of triumph, it was Mr. Balfour’s
day. He made a little speech which
will stick long in the minds of those who
heard it.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“It so happens,” said Mr. Balfour, “that
I was at the head of the British administration
which twenty years ago brought the
great Anglo-Japanese Alliance into existence.
It so happens that I was at the head
of the British Administration which brought
into existence an entente between the British
Empire and France, and through all my life
I have been a constant, ardent and persistent
advocate of intimate and friendly relations
between the two great branches of
the English-speaking race.</p>

<p class='c019'>“You may well conceive, therefore, how
deep is my satisfaction when I see all these
four powers putting their signatures to a
treaty which I believe will for all time insure
perfect harmony of coöperation between
them in the great region with which
the treaty deals.”</p>

<p class='c019'>That little speech gave one a clearer sense
of what through all these years Arthur Balfour
has been doing than anything that
ever has before come to me. There is something
supremely brave about a man of such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>fine understanding, such humorous and distinguished
cynicism, standing by through
all of the disillusions, disgust, deceptions,
forced evil choices of public life, never quitting
whatever the temptation. For forty
years now Arthur Balfour has stood by.
He is, I believe, 73 years old. He has never
had so much reason in all his long political
career to believe that the good will of men
can be mobilized for the world’s service.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was a great week, noble in its undertaking,
dramatic in its planning, the just
triumph of a people who know what they
want and are willing to wait to get it. And
for us, America, it was a week of brave
deeds. We were coming to our senses, realizing
that we are of the world, and if we
are to enjoy its fruits, we must bear our
share of its burdens; that if we would have
peace, the surest way is to use our strength
and our good will to guarantee it.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE MOODS OF AN INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>If we are to succeed in repairing this battered
world through the medium of the International
Conference, then plainly it is
the business of us all to try to understand
the methods, the conduct and particularly
the moods of this instrument of peace. It
is as temperamental as a stock exchange.
The Washington Conference began with a
period of tremendous exultation. Mr.
Hughes’ great naval program lifted the
world. For ten days this mood prevailed.
Then came the French in the person of their
Prime Minister, Briand, and in an hour he
had the temple of peace rocking on its base.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was very interesting to see how the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>men who made up the Conference went
steadily ahead from ten to six every day—and
sometimes longer—in spite of the excitement
M. Briand had stirred up. It
was a fine example of the stabilizing effect
of a daily task regularly followed. They
went on for four weeks and then again
stirred the world to enthusiasm by their
Four Power Pact; their removal of the Yap
irritation; their consent to the Japanese
mandate in the Pacific; their acceptance of
the Five-Five-Three naval ratio. At one
swoop the war with Japan that a part of
the American public has so sedulously cultivated
for a good term of years was wiped
off the map—unless the United States Senate
prefer to restore it to its position.</p>

<p class='c019'>However, the naval program was not a
fact accomplished until France and Italy
had consented to a ratio. That was the
next step, and Mr. Hughes seemed to have
turned to it with the utmost confidence—1.75
was the ratio he had fixed on as
proper; then suddenly, without any warning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>the soaring stock of the Conference
dropped way below par. A British journalist,
with more love of sensation than the
honor of his profession, announced that the
French had told the naval committee that
France wanted to build ten 35,000 ton ships.
The effect of those numbers suddenly thrown
on a table where the figuring for weeks had
been down, not up, was more nearly to throw
the Conference delegates off their feet than
anything that had happened to date. There
was no questioning their dismay, for while
Mr. Balfour and Mr. Hughes refused, as it
was proper for them to do, to discuss the
matter, while the French likewise kept their
mouths shut, and complained that they had
been betrayed, Mr. Hughes showed his excitement
by a long cablegram, appealing to
M. Briand, over the head of the then acting
chief of the French delegation, M. Sarraut.
Outside the Conference an excited world
declared the whole thing was wrecked and
that France had wrecked it.</p>

<p class='c019'>Could this unhappy incident have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>avoided? If the Conference had shown a
more sympathetic understanding of the way
France is feeling to-day, if there had been
the realization which we certainly should
expect of the effect of calling her into a
gathering of this kind and then letting her
Premier sit for a week with practically no
attention, it probably would have been.
When M. Briand was leaving the Conference
on the opening day an American journalist
asked him what he thought of it. The
American way, he said, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à la Américaine</span>.”
And then he went on to remark that when
the time came France would do like Mr.
Hughes and talk in the American way.
Weeks went on and France had no chance
to talk in anybody’s way about her naval
ratio. Everybody else but herself seems
to have taken it for granted that 1.75 was
to be her proportion. When her turn finally
came, however, she began to hurl capital
ships at Mr. Hughes’ program—ten of them,
35,000 tons each. The figures looked appalling,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>preposterous—they produced, as I
have said, almost a panic. Now, obviously,
the panic would have been avoided, as far
as the public is concerned, if the matter had
been kept in committee where it belonged
and where the French intended to keep it.
Given to the public, it stirred up anger on
both sides of the water, whipped up suspicion,
set all the busybodies at inventing
far-fetched explanations and reading sinister
meanings into the French proposal.</p>

<p class='c019'>There was little trouble when Mr. Hughes
appealed to M. Briand in getting the capital-ship
ratio dropped back to the 1.75 first
suggested. But along with this concession
in the matter of capital ships went the decision
that France would not limit her submarines
and auxiliary craft. She wanted
unlimited submarines for defense—defense
against whom? It must be us, said England.
She wanted auxiliary craft for the
protection of scattered colonies. Here she
took her position and here she remained.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Mr. Hughes’ naval program leaves the number
of submarines and light craft a nation
builds at its discretion. Too bad—could it
have been avoided?</p>

<p class='c019'>One thing seems quite certain, that Mr.
Hughes missed a tremendous opportunity
in not boldly declaring in his original program
that as for the United States, it was
done with submarines. We did that at
Paris in 1919. The head of our delegation,
President Wilson, and his naval advisers
agreed that in the disarmament pledged by
the League of Nations the submarine was
one weapon which could and should be put
entirely out of existence. Its record of cowardice
and plain murder no one could defend.
The treaty of Versailles forbade the
Germans to construct submarines for any
purpose, and it certainly was the farthest
from the thought of the majority of those
who made that treaty that they were laying
down one rule for Germany and another
for themselves. The idea there was to disarm
and to begin with Germany.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>Why the American delegation should not
have followed that policy here in regard
to the submarine is not clear. But when
it was not done in the opening program, it
is still less understandable why they did not
seize the British suggestion when it was
made by Mr. Balfour. The British had the
American program for naval reduction
flung into their faces without warning, and
they picked it up like wonderful sports, as
did the Japanese. But when Mr. Balfour
notified the Conference that he should propose
complete abolition of the submarine,
there was no such response. There were not
a few of us who had an uncomfortable chill
over the Washington Conference when our
government failed promptly to follow the
British in this policy, failed to say, “Yes,
we are with you, it’s beastly business this
submarine warfare—one thing we can do
away with. We will join you in outlawing
it.” But this was not done, and because it
was not done, coupled with France’s determination
to seize every chance that came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>along to secure recognition for herself, to
enforce her argument that she must be prepared
to defend herself, since nobody in the
world seemed prepared to give her the guarantees
which she thought necessary, if she
were to disarm, the submarine came in to
trouble Mr. Hughes’ program, and, incidentally,
to spoil the Conference’s holiday
week.</p>

<p class='c019'>The regret was the greater because the
arguments that Lord Lee and Mr. Balfour
had put up for the abolition of the submarine
were so weighty and conclusive that
if they could have been presented at the
start, or at least earlier in the negotiations,
there seems to be little doubt that they
would not have won over the Conference.
These arguments have the backing of Great
Britain’s experience with submarines, the
most serious and extensive experience that
any nation has yet had with this particular
weapon. Lord Lee and Mr. Balfour had
the facts to show that the German submarine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>fleet was able to accomplish relatively
little in the Great War in the way of
legitimate naval warfare. It left the British
Grand Fleet untouched. In spite of all
its efforts, it did not prevent the British taking
fifteen million troops across the English
Channel, and the Americans two million
across the Atlantic. It was of little use to
the British in guarding their coast line,
which, as Lord Lee pointed out, was almost
as great as the combined coast line of the
four other powers in the discussion. What
the German submarine fleet did do, however,
was to destroy some twelve million
tons of mercantile shipping and murder
twenty thousand non-combatants—men,
women and children. The counter defense
against the submarine has been so developed,
Lord Lee claimed, that an attacking
fleet could be equipped to resist any number
of them. That is, the methods of detecting,
locating and destroying submarines have
greatly outstripped their offensive power.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>One of the strong arguments for the abolition
of the submarine is the fact that it is
possible to abolish it by general consent.
Its case is very different from that of poison
gas, which is a by-product of essential industries.
You do not need to set out to find
poison gasses; they come to you in the natural
course of chemical research, and they
do not have to be manufactured until you
are forced to do it for defense. Moreover,
they have the enormous advantage of not
looking like war. They are disgusting, hateful
things against which man instinctively
revolts. They do not tempt the adventurous,
as the submarine does.</p>

<p class='c019'>Although the French particularly,
through Admiral le Bon and M. Sarraut,
did their utmost to combat the British position,
their arguments had little weight in
comparison with the British. The entire
discussion which ran more than a week and
which was given out day by day practically
in full to the press only emphasized my feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>that the French, in insisting on a fleet
of submarines all out of proportion to that
contemplated in the original American program,
were actuated more by a desire to
assert themselves in this council of nations,
to demonstrate that it is not safe to overlook
their susceptibilities, than from any
desire to have submarines for defense. If
the representatives of the United States are
to work successfully with other nations in
international conferences, they must learn
that diplomats can no more afford to overlook
the feelings of other nations than an
engineer can afford to overlook the susceptibilities
of the iron and steel which he employs.
France’s acute sensitiveness, her
black imaginations, may irritate Americans
who know nothing of invaded and devastated
territory, who have not had to sit
through five long years with the sound of
bursting shells continually in their ears;
but if they have not the imagination and
the sympathy to tell them what the results
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>of such an experience are, then let them
accept the judgment of physicians and
realize that in whatever negotiations they
have with the French people at this time,
their shell-shocked minds and souls must be
taken into account.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Hughes lost a second great opportunity
in the submarine matter. A few days
before Christmas, when it became obvious
that the submarine was in danger of destroying
the American delegation’s plans
for a glorious Christmas present to the nation,
Mr. Balfour asked for an open session
in which to discuss the matter. For some
reason not at all clear, Mr. Hughes did not
consent. Our Secretary of State proved
himself a superior dramatist at the Conference,
but in this instance a poor psychologist!
If there was to be no holiday, as had
become clear, then an open session with a
chance to hear Mr. Balfour, Lord Lee, M.
Sarraut, Admiral le Bon, Senator Schanzer,
in the free discussion of a matter in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>the whole country was tremendously interested—such
an open session would have been
a Christmas present in itself, and it would
have done much to have cleared up the thick
atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c019'>In these conferences the atmosphere easily
becomes heavy with suspicion. The
sight of a group of eminent gentlemen of
various nationalities shutting themselves
up morning after morning, for hours, considering
matters which concern the peace
and happiness of the world, if too long continued,
stirs up resentment in the best of
us. If you are an impersonal, detached,
philosophical, fairly well-informed person,
it is not difficult for you to visualize what
those gentlemen are doing; if you take the
trouble you can even build up in your mind
what they are saying. Suppose it is a question
of the ratio of capital ships. You know
that they are listening to disputes over tonnage
and the way it has been computed, are
studying long arrays of figures, matters dull
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>in themselves and requiring the closest attention.
Most of us would not remain a
half hour, unless we were compelled to when
such discussions were going on. But if you
are a suspicious person, if you have been
trained in the cynical school of sensational
journalism, to look for mischief and intrigue—and
often it must be confessed finding
it—you have dark thoughts about the
gentlemen.</p>

<p class='c019'>The only way in which such suspicions
can be cleared up—or better, prevented,—is
by frequent open sessions and much freer
discussion at those sessions than we had at
the Conference for Limitation of Armament.
Some of the Americans prominent in the
Conference have in the last two years frequently
criticized the secrecy with which
the Paris Conference was conducted but
there was very little difference in the procedure
from that in Paris. The work there
as here was done in committees. There as
here there were daily communications to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>press. They were more satisfactory here,
fuller, but that was made possible by the
fact that the situation here was far less
complicated and by the rigor with which
Mr. Hughes kept one thing at a time on the
table. As for the press conferences, in
Paris as here they were held daily by the
Americans and frequently by all of the other
delegations. Nobody in Paris, of course,
was so satisfactory to the press as Mr.
Hughes. His candor, his good humor, his
out-and-out, man-to-man conduct of his
daily meeting cannot be too highly praised.
He has set a pace for this sort of thing very
hard to follow. There was no American in
Paris in a position to do for the press what
Mr. Hughes did in Washington. President
Wilson had not the time. The other members
of the delegation were not in Mr.
Hughes’ position. Nobody else in our delegation
here would have had the authority,
even if he had had the ability, to do what
Mr. Hughes did. The difference here and in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Paris was mainly a difference of situation—the
difference between an infinitely difficult
and complicated situation and a comparatively
well defined and definite one.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Hughes himself was partly responsible
for the resentment that the press felt
at the failure to follow Mr. Balfour’s suggestion
and conduct the submarine discussion
in the open. Any one who took the
pains to read the text of these discussions as
they were printed in the leading journals of
the country, can see how well adapted they
were to a public meeting. There was nothing
in them that would jeopardize any nation;
there was much in them that would
have been illuminated, its impression intensified,
if it could have been heard instead
of read. Mr. Hughes in his talk of
these discussions to the correspondents was
actually tantalizing. When he walked
briskly into his press conference at the end
of a long committee discussion and told a
hundred and more men and women gathered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>around him what an intellectual treat
it had been, of how Mr. Balfour had been
in his best form, of how lively the exchange
had been between French and English, his
snapping eyes, his appreciative voice, his
glow of enthusiasm, were actually antagonizing.
He overlooked entirely the fact that
he was making more than one in the assembly
say: Selfish man, don’t you suppose
that we would have enjoyed seeing and hearing
Mr. Balfour in his best form? Is there
anything at this Conference that we would
have liked so much, except of course hearing
you? Do you think we are going to be
satisfied with your promise that we shall
have full reports of all that was said?</p>

<p class='c019'>I know very well that it is not considered
good form to use the words League of Nations
in connection with the Conference on
the Limitation of Armament, and no offense
is intended—but if one is really interested
in trying to decide just how much publicity
is wise in such a conference as this, any experience
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of other similar bodies should be
considered, and after all it cannot be denied
that the assembly of the League of Nations
is a similar body to this, the chief difference
being that it includes some fifty nations
instead of nine. At the second meeting
of the assembly of the League last fall,
lasting four and a half weeks, there were 33
plenary conferences. One cannot say that
the matters under consideration there were
less delicate and dangerous than in Washington.
They were even more inflamed at
the moment, including such open irruptions
as the boundary dispute between Jugo-Slavia
and Albania.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was not only Mr. Hughes’ naval program
that was seeing heavy weather; the
Four Power Pact was in trouble. The President
did not agree with the American delegation
that the mainland of Japan was covered
by the treaty. For my part I had
never questioned that when this Four Power
Pact talked about insular dominions as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>well as insular possessions it meant what it
said, and that Nippon as well as Australia
and New Zealand was included. Moreover,
Mr. Hughes had repeatedly told the press
that was the intention. There seems, however,
to have been doubts in some minds,
and when finally twelve days after the Pact
itself was submitted and accepted by the
full Conference, an insistent journalist presented
Mr. Harding at his biweekly press
meeting with a written question. (The
President was now requiring all questions
at these gatherings to be submitted in writing.)
He remarked in his casual manner,
“No, the Japan mainland is not included
in the treaty.” To be sure he took it back
that night in a public document, but here
was food for the trouble makers—a disagreement
in the cabinet! All of those who, while
loudly declaring themselves advocates of
peace, were doing their utmost to belittle
the efforts of the responsible, to magnify
differences in interpretation, to fan partisan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>jealousies, to read in intrigue and deceit and
concealment where there was usually nothing
worse than blundering or stupidity, declared
with satisfaction or despair that the
Conference was now surely wrecked. Joined
to the cry of anguish that was rising over
the failure to limit the submarine and auxiliary
craft, the chorus was dismal enough.</p>

<p class='c019'>Little by little, however, events shut off
the pessimists. For instance, one of the
“intrigues” that had been brought to light
was that Japan and France had combined
on the submarine issue, and were lining up
in the Conference against England and
America. But Japan destroyed that fine
morsel, declaring formally that she felt
it would be a misfortune if the Conference
failed to come to an agreement on limitation;
that she supported the original American
proposal of November 12 in regard to
auxiliary craft and hoped that agreement
would be reached on that basis.</p>

<p class='c019'>She followed this quieting information by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>an announcement that she did not consider
it consistent with her dignity as one of the
four powers to accept any special protection,
and that she therefore asked that the Four
Power treaty be amended so as to exclude
her mainland.</p>

<p class='c019'>Even the submarine became less threatening
as the discussion went on. If it was
not to be limited in number, it was in field
of action—so far as a rule of war could
limit. If auxiliary craft were to be built according
to the “needs” of each nation, their
tonnage was not to run over 10,000 tons
each and their guns were to be but eight
inch. Add this to the ratio in capital ships
now fixed—5–5–3—1.75—1.75—and to a ten
years’ naval holiday, and you had a solid
something.</p>

<p class='c019'>One grew philosophical again and reflected
how childish it was to suppose that
a Conference of this importance could be
carried on without sharp differences of opinion,
without those periods which we call
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“deadlocks,” without the flaring up at times
of century-old feuds, such as that between
Great Britain and France. All of these
things, we told ourselves, were part of the
problem of working out new understandings,
and to overemphasize them or willfully
to exploit them in order to increase
ill will and obstruct a progress which was
necessarily slow and difficult, was work fit
only for the irresponsible and the malicious.</p>

<p class='c019'>The naval program was certain of adoption.
There were details still unsettled, but
it seemed safe to assume that if the patience
and good will of the delegates stood the
strain, these details would be satisfactorily
arranged; but, as from the start, the final
success of the Conference depended upon
removing the fears that England, Japan and
the United States had of one another, of
our securing reasonable assurance that our
policies of the open door in China and of
moral trusteeship for Russia and China
were adopted. We had proposed a pact and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>it had been accepted; principles regarding
China and they had been accepted; but this
was by no means all of the Far Eastern
problem. By Christmas we were at the
heart of it—the hostile relations of China
and Japan, and whether it was possible
to help them to peacefully adjust these
relations.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <span class='large'>PUT YOURSELF IN THEIR PLACES</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>A shrewd, reflective and cynical doorman
with whom I sometimes discussed affairs of
state in Washington, confided to me on one
of the busy days just before the opening
of the Conference on the Limitation of
Armament that in his judgment there was
a peck of trouble about to be turned loose
on the American Government.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Take them Japs and Chinamen,” he said,
“they’re coming with bags of problems, and
they’re going to dump them on us to sort
and solve! And to think we brought it on
ourselves!”</p>

<p class='c019'>There were people nearer to the administration
than this anxious observer who
said the same thing. “The Far East is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>veritable Pandora’s box, and why did we
open it?”</p>

<p class='c019'>I don’t remember ever to have seen in
Washington, even in war times, so many responsible
people who gave me the impression
of wanting to hold their heads to keep
them from splitting.</p>

<p class='c019'>Of one thing there was no doubt—if the
troubles that were to be loosed on the
Conference were as serious as these serious
observers feared, it was better that they
be <em>out</em> than <em>in</em> the box, for they were of a
nature that, confined, would be sure to explode,
but give them time and they might
dissolve under the healing touch of light,
sun and air.</p>

<p class='c019'>But why were there people close to things
in Washington aghast at the program of the
Conference, people who two months before
had looked forward to it with confidence and
even exultation? No doubt this was explained
partly by the realization that cutting
down armaments did not necessarily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>mean long-continued peace; that there must
be settlements. When they looked over the
problems to be settled, attempted to put
themselves in the place of the people concerned,
find solutions through agreements
which did not require force behind them,
they were appalled at the difficulties in the
way.</p>

<p class='c019'>Put the problems which disturbed them
into their simplest terms:—Japan could not
get enough food on her six big and her 600
little islands for her 60,000,000 people. She
was spilling over into China and its dependencies—not
merely as a settler, content
to till the soil, to work the mines, to sell
in the market place, but as an aggressive
conqueror, aspiring to military and political
control as well as economic opportunity.</p>

<p class='c019'>China—that is, Young China, the founder
of the Republic—said she would not have
it, that she must govern and administer her
own, and we, China’s friend, were backing
the integrity she demanded. But Japan was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>“in China”—“in” as was Great Britain and
France. She had an army and navy to back
her pretensions and she could very well say—and did—“Why
should Great Britain and
France be allowed to hold their political
and military control in Hongkong and in
Tonkin, raise and train troops, not of their
own people but of natives, collect taxes,
run post offices, and we be forbidden? If
they do these things, and they do, why
should Japan not have equal privileges?”</p>

<p class='c019'>Young China answered this pertinent inquiry:
“It was Old China that arranged
those things. You are dealing now with
a new China, one that does not intend to
barter its inheritance, that proposes to rule
its own; a China that will no longer submit
to having a carving knife applied to
its heart.</p>

<p class='c019'>“What Old China did we inherited and
must make the best of, but it is our duty to
see that no nation on earth ever again takes
from us what we do not willingly give. You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>must abandon your effort to direct our policies,
administer our railroads, keep your
troops on our soil.”</p>

<p class='c019'>What frightened my doorkeeper, who got
his views from the press, and the press that
got its views from a hundred conflicting
sources, was how peacefully Japan’s right
to food for her people and China’s right to
her own were to be squared. Could the one
inalienable right be fitted into the other inalienable
right by other means than force?
Of course there were many places on the
earth beside China where Japan might expand,
but search as they would these anxious
observers did not find any available
spot except in Asia.</p>

<p class='c019'>One of the chief occupations of these
friends of mine in Washington as the peace
conference opened was trying to find some
territory from which Japan could get her
food; something the Conference could
“give” her; something that would satisfy
her. As things now are such a search must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>start with the provision that there is nothing
for Japan on the Western Hemisphere.
Obviously there is no place for her in Europe.
Australia will not have her; we will
not have her.</p>

<p class='c019'>“If it were a question of war or restricted
immigration,” I asked a Californian in the
course of the Far Eastern discussion, “which
would you choose?” The look of surprise
at the question answered me—“War.” I
received the same reply from a Canadian—from
an American labor leader—and they
were all “pacifists”!</p>

<p class='c019'>The narrower the confines were drawn
around Japan, the more hysterical observers
grew in their search, the more they insisted
the Conference must “give” Japan
something. “Give it Eastern Siberia!” But
what right did the Conference have to deal
with any part of Siberia? The United
States had finally settled her attitude to
this suggestion by declaring that she would
not consider any partitioning of Russian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>territory. She refused to countenance the
carving up of Russia as she did the further
carving up of China. She refused even to
recognize the government that was now
struggling to plant itself in Eastern Siberia.
It was Russia’s problem to take care
of the Far Eastern Republic. She must be
free, as China must be free, to work out her
own destiny.</p>

<p class='c019'>Then “give” Japan Manchuria! She already
had important recognized rights in
Southern Manchuria, rights that came from
old wars; the territory borders on Korea
which Japan holds and governs, and undoubtedly
the Conference would not dispute
her claim to Korea, since that claim stands
on about the same kind of a bottom as England’s
claim to Hongkong and France’s
to Tonkin. It was the fruit of the nation’s
dealing with Old China. This being
so and Japan having her established hold
in Southern Manchuria and having made
a remarkable record, give her the country.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>But here came Young China again.
“Manchuria is ours,” she said. “We will not
recognize the rights that Japan claims
through her treaty made in 1915. It
really was a treaty with Old China, still
alive in our Republic. It was wrested from
us by cunning and bribery. There are
twenty million Chinese in Manchuria. They
have made that province grow more rapidly
in wealth in recent years than any other
part of the land. They are converting the
wilderness, raising such a crop of soy beans
as no other part of the earth has ever seen.
We propose to stand by our people. We
cannot give Manchuria to Japan, nor can
we give her Mongolia. Here, too, our people
are good, patient, hardy settlers, peacefully
converting the wilderness. True,
there are great tracts still untouched, but
remember that we have surplus millions,
and it is here that we expect them to
expand.”</p>

<p class='c019'>What set my doorman and many serious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>onlookers to holding their heads was that
they could not find a place to <em>put</em> Japan;
that is, a place to which she would not have
to fight her way.</p>

<p class='c019'>But what are they doing in the search of
the earth for something to “give” her? Was
it anything but following the old formula
that has always gone with wars? Was war
anything but a necessary corollary to this
way of dealing with the earth’s surface?
No nation or group of nations ever has or
will give away without its consent the property
of another nation without sowing
trouble for the future.</p>

<p class='c019'>Races must settle their own destinies.
Japan must settle her food problem by war
or by peace, and whether it was to be by
the one or by the other depended largely
upon Young China. What did Young
China think about it? Not a hasty, violent
Young China, expecting to convert its great
masses in an hour to the Republican form
of government that came into being ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>years ago, but a moderate Young China, that
has stayed at home, that knows its people,
that is conscious of the length of time, the
patience, the sacrifices, the pain that adapting
the mind of China to a new order
requires.</p>

<p class='c019'>What did this moderate Young China
think about the relation of Japan to itself?
I looked him up and asked.</p>

<p class='c019'>He made it quite clear that the Republic
had come to stay. He did not attempt to
minimize its difficulties. He did claim, however,
that whatever the surface indications,
the whole Yangtze Valley, which is the very
heart of the country, is committed to the
Republic, and is coöperating with it. He
gave a hundred indications of how from this
great central artery running east and west
democratic influences are surely and
steadily spreading north and south. He
showed how in the northern provinces the
progress was slowest, most difficult, because
here conservatism was strongest, most corrupt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>He pointed out how Old China is concentrating
in the Peking government all its
cunning, its wisdom, its appeal to the old
thing, but he claimed, and unquestionably
believed, that Young China was going to
be too much for it. He went over the southern
provinces and showed how in all of them,
except Canton, there was a steadily improving
coöperation with the Peking government.</p>

<p class='c019'>Moderate Young China thinks Canton is
wrong in its haste. He does not believe
that the people can assimilate the new ideas
as rapidly as Canton claims. He believes
that its hurry to make over a great country
is one of the most dangerous factors in
the nation’s present problem. To sustain,
guard, and develop the struggling Peking
government is his program.</p>

<p class='c019'>“We are quarreling, to be sure,” moderate
Young China said, “but it is <em>our</em> quarrel.
We are like brothers who have fallen to
beating one another—let a neighbor interfere
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>and both turn on him. China will turn
on any nation or nations that attempt to
coerce her. She alone can work out her
difficulties. She can work out best her disputes
with Japan, and if let alone, will do
so.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“Of course,” continued Young China,
“Japan must resign control of Shantung,
and particularly of the Shantung railroad.
Look at the map and you will understand
why. If Japan controls the Shantung railroad
she can at any moment cut our main
rail communication between Peking and
Shanghai, destroy the main artery of our
circulatory system. She can do more than
that. By that control she will be able to
cut off the two arteries across the mainland,
the Yellow River and the Yangtze. No government
in its senses could permit that.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Nor can we consent to her political and
military control, either, in Shantung or
Manchuria. But that does not mean, as
some people pretend, that we want to drive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>Japan from our country. No intelligent
Chinaman does. We need the Japanese
to help us open and develop our resources,
to buy our raw material; and Japan needs
our market in which to sell. We are willing
she should have the fullest economic
privileges if she will cease to interfere with
our policies and will withdraw her troops.</p>

<p class='c019'>“If she will coöperate with us on an economic
basis purely and simply Young China
will welcome Japan and there are liberal
Japanese that will do that. It is only Military
Japan, believing in progress by force,
that threatens us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>“How are you going to carry out your
program? How enforce it?”</p>

<p class='c019'>“The economic boycott,” he said. “It has
been successful so far. We’ll neither buy
of Japan nor sell to her until she gives up
her pretensions.”</p>

<p class='c019'>There is something tremendous in the
idea of that great passive three hundred and
twenty-five million or more, the greatest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>single market on earth, and Japan’s natural
market, passing by on the other side, leaving
the goods untouched on docks and warehouses—but
they do it. There are children
of China who will refuse a toy to-day if
told it was made in Japan, will go hungry
rather than eat Japanese food, so they told
me, these ardent young Chinamen.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But if Japan insists on her demands,
turns her navy on you?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c019'>“Ah, then,” said trustful Young China,
“our great friend the United States will
take a hand. She will not permit Japan to
force us.”</p>

<p class='c019'>This confidence in America’s friendship
was China’s strongest card at the peace
table. For over sixty years we have been
her avowed protector—ever since in 1858
we signed the quaintly worded compact:
“They (the United States and China)
shall not insult or oppress each other for
any trifling cause so as to produce an estrangement
between them, and if any other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>nation should act unjustly or oppressively,
the United States will exert their good offices
on being informed of the case to bring
about an amicable arrangement of the question,
thus showing their friendly feeling.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Faith in the protection of the United
States has worked its way far inland, to
the very sources of the Yellow and the
Yangtze rivers. I am told that many Chinamen
in those distant places who never have
looked on a white face will point to the
Stars and Stripes and say “our friend.”</p>

<p class='c019'>According to moderate Young China’s
view of the case, the work of the Conference
on the Limitation of Armament was to persuade
Japan that her real economic progress
lay in giving up the political and military
privileges in China which she believes
are fairly hers, as spoils of the late war, and
to accept full opportunities of “peaceful
penetration”—persuade if possible, force if
not!</p>

<p class='c019'>There was no question of where sympathy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>lay at the opening of the Conference—it
was with moderate Young China. Sympathy
for her and suspicion for Japan—this
showed in a catlike watchfulness of Japan’s
every move, particularly by the newspaper
correspondents.</p>

<p class='c019'>As a rule, newspaper people are instinctively
suspicious. It seems sometimes to be
the pride of the profession, and a smart
characterization of a suspicion has almost
the value of a scoop. There was an instance
at the opening of the Conference, just after
the naval program was announced, when
Ambassador Shidehara fell ill of intestinal
trouble. It had been announced that Japan
could make no reply to the naval program
until she had communicated with Tokyo,
and somebody remarked brilliantly that the
Baron’s illness was probably a “congestion
of the cables.” As a matter of fact it
turned out that the poor Baron was seriously
ill, but the phrase stuck.</p>

<p class='c019'>At the first press conference given by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>Admiral Baron Kato there was another
evidence of this instinct. An interpreter
translated the questions of the correspondent
to the Admiral who replied in his native
tongue, a delightfully musical voice; you
could hardly believe you did not understand
him, so understandable did his words sound.
Once or twice Baron Kato did not wait for
the interpreter to repeat the English question
to him, but gave his answer at once
in Japanese. Instantaneously there ran
around the big circle of men the signal
“He understands English.” Any one who
has had any experience with a foreign language
knows that often one does understand,
but cannot speak; moreover, one understands
when the question is simple but
cannot follow it when involved. The point
is simply here, that the moment Baron
Kato showed he understood any English,
the guards of the men were up. He was
a Jap and must be watched. That is,
Japan came to the Washington Conference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>handicapped by the suspicion of the American
press and public, while China came
strong in our good will.</p>

<p class='c019'>Was there anything to be said for Japan?
I had believed so a long time, but felt that
my impressions were treasonable, so contrary
were they to the expressed judgment
of practically all of my liberal and radical
friends—many of them knew vastly more
than I did about the Far East—and to the
feeling of the general public as I caught it
in the press and in conversation. My treason
consisted in thinking that although, as
a matter of fact, Japan had been doing a
variety of outrageous things, if you compared
her operations with those of most of
us, there was little reason to make a scapegoat
of her. I have been impressed often in
the last three years that there were a good
many people trying to help China by crying
down Japan—a practice that has played
a mischievous part in history. I felt that
we were not giving Japan the fair deal we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>should, even if we had no other object than
aiding China. The books I read, the observers
from the Far East with whom I
talked, almost invariably were partisan in
their attack. They liked one and did not
like the other. Everything that one did
was understandable and excusable; everything
that the other did was oppressive
and inexcusable.</p>

<p class='c019'>The Japanese had not been long at the
Washington Conference, however, before
their stock began to rise. The delegation
was the most diligent, serious, modest body
at the Conference, and so very grateful for
every kind word! The contrast between
the Chinese and Japanese delegations was
striking. Nothing more modernized in manner
and appearance, democratized in
speech, gathered in Washington than the
Chinese. They looked, talked, acted like
the most sophisticated and delightful of
cultivated Europeans. They understood
and practiced every social amenity—suave,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>at home, frank, gay—I have never encountered
anything more socially superior than
some of the young Chinese. The two delegations
were perfectly characterized by a
woman friend of mine familiar with both
peoples—“The Chinese look down on everybody;
the Japanese look up to everybody.”
That was the impression. But when it came
to diplomacy, the Chinaman was the aristocrat
begging favors, the Japanese the
plebeian fighting for his rights.</p>

<p class='c019'>The Japanese seemed to have felt that
possibly there might be some intent on the
part of their Western brothers to throw
them out of China and go in themselves.
We cannot blame Japan for such a thought
if we review her experience with the West
in the last twenty-five years. She was
forced into Korea, after China had agreed
with her to jointly suppress disorders if
they broke out and both of them to withdraw
when there was no longer need for
their work. It was China’s refusal to abide
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>by the treaty of 1885 that led Japan into
war and that brought her, as a result of
that war, Formosa, the Pescadores, Liaotung,
with Port Arthur and Dalny. We all
remember—that is, those of us living then—how
only a few days after the treaty with
China which gave Japan these territories
the Czar stepped in and told Japan that he
would “give her a new proof of his sincere
friendship” by taking over Liaotung. There
was nothing for Japan to do but accept the
offer.</p>

<p class='c019'>Pretty nearly all Europe at once proceeded,
as everybody remembers, to give
China and Japan further “proofs of sincere
friendship.” Germany took over Kiaochow;
England, Weihaiwei; France, Kwang chowwan.
This is only a little over twenty years
ago.</p>

<p class='c019'>It was Russia’s obvious effort to get
Japan out of Korea that caused the Russo-Japanese
war, a war which amazed the
world by its result, put Japan on the map,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>very possibly turned her head a bit. She
had been studying the West, and the remarkable
thing about this country which
we call imitative, in studying it she had
learned not only its power but its weakness.
She had accepted its militarism at its full
face value, but she had quickly put her finger
on the weak spots in the militarism of
different nations. She had seen how corruption,
bribery, self-indulgence had weakened
the militarism of Russia; she saw how
the half-heartedness of France and England
in war weakened them, how liberalism and
pacifism undermined militarism; she saw
how Germany had the pure science and undivided
devotion, and she took Germany as
her model. And then in 1914 her great
chance came. She did exactly what the
Prussian would have done if he had been in
her place. She joined the strong, her great
ally, England, against Germany, for Germany
had possessions in China which Japan
coveted. She out-Prussianized Prussia in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>the demands she made upon the corrupt
and unstable Peking crowd. There is no
shadow of defense for the twenty-one demands,
except the defense that she was applying
the lessons that she had learned
from Russia, from Germany—lessons which
she had seen applied, in a modified form, it
is true, but still in a form by England and
by the United States in the Philippines.</p>

<p class='c019'>I could never forget all this in Paris.
Japan came to the Conference peace table
with her treaties—read them in that invaluable
compilation of treaties which John McMurray
has made and the Carnegie Peace
Foundation published. England there sets
down her approval; France sets down her
approval; they promise the German rights
in Shantung to Japan when the treaty shall
be made; they promise her the Caroline
Islands and the other island possessions of
Germany north of the equator. This is all
written down in the books, and this was
what faced President Wilson when the matter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>of Shantung was taken up. What were
England and France to do? England had
gone into a war and we had followed her,
largely, so we both claimed, because a
treaty had been regarded as a scrap of
paper. Were you now to treat other
treaties as scraps of paper?</p>

<p class='c019'>Italy would not have it so. She held
France and England to their war promises.
And when President Wilson balked, she left
the peace table.</p>

<p class='c019'>One of the things that interested me most
in Paris was that Japan never left the
peace table. She was apparently willing to
trade anything to get that recognition of
racial equality denied her, so far as one can
make out, because she is so able, not at all
because she is an inferior. She hung on,
and by the sheer strength of her position,
her refusal, whatever she got or did not get
to quit the game, came out with a recognition,
partial at least, of what may be correctly
called her nefarious demands.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>And then she found herself with a whole
world jumping on her back. She had played
the Western game and the West despised
her. I could not help feeling in Paris that
Japan must have been bewildered a little by
the contradictions of the Occident she had
tried so faithfully to follow. She saw the
doctrine of force she had accepted grappling
with the gospel of the brotherhood of man.
There are many who think that the brotherhood
got the worst of it in Paris. That gospel
was driven into the world as never before
there. More people were committed to
it than ever before. More people realized
that it is a power that you must count with
in the affairs of nations as well as of individuals.
More people accepted it and tried
to get together to make it a practical reality.
Japan herself bowed before the power
of this spirit before she left Paris. She
never gave up more because of it than she
felt she must, but she gave up rather than
quit the game. She was learning. She has
been learning ever since. She has never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>stayed away from any international attempt
to bring order to the world. She has had a
bevy of her people at every meeting of the
League of Nations. She has taken an active
part in the work of all of its commissions.
In 1919 Japan had eighty-seven delegates
at the International Labor Conference
held in Washington, and those delegates
accepted the radical program there
adopted. Japan means to understand the
Occident; and she is making the same valiant
attempt to ally herself with the best of
the Occident that before the war she made
to ally herself with the worst.</p>

<p class='c019'>What we have to remember is that Japan
is, like all nations to a degree, a dual nation;
there are two Japans—the one clinging
to the old militaristic, autocratic notion
of government, the other struggling to understand
and realize the meaning of a
united, coöperating world in which each
man and each nation shall have a chance at
peaceful, prosperous living.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>
  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER X<br /> <span class='large'>CHINA AT THE CONFERENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>The most difficult problems with which
the Conference for the Limitation of Armament
had to deal were those centering about
China. We wanted China to have her own.
We wanted her to be let alone, to run her
government to suit herself, to be free from
exploitation, duress, intrigues. As a people
we wanted this very much. We came as
near being sentimental over China as one
nation can be over another. We like the
Chinese as a people. We would like to see
them as sanitary as they are friendly, as
honest as they are industrious, as free from
their own vices as they are from most of
ours.</p>

<p class='c019'>We are more sentimental about them because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>our own dealings with them have
been on the whole so fair. We are proud
of the position we have taken as a nation
toward China and we would like to keep up
our record, justifying the Chinese conviction
that we are a disinterested and reliable
friend. Our dealings have been decent—the
policy of the Open Door, the return of
a large share of the Boxer indemnity, the
protest that we made in 1915 when we
learned of the outrageous twenty-one demands
that Japan had forced from the
Peking government: we have prided ourselves
on these things, and when at Paris
in 1919 President Wilson consented to the
transfer of the German rights in Shantung
to Japan, there was a chorus of disapproval,
and we came to this Conference resolved
that Shantung should be restored to
China; moreover, that a long list of interferences
with her freedom of administration
should cease. The disappointment came in
finding that what China wanted, and we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>wanted her to have, was much more difficult
to realize than we had appreciated, and that
in a majority of cases, probably the worst
thing that could happen would be to have
her full requests granted.</p>

<p class='c019'>The primary difficulty in China’s getting
what she wanted was that she has no stable
government, nothing upon which she can
depend and with which the nations can deal
with any assurance that the engagements
that are entered into will be faithfully carried
out. The Conference began with an
exhibit of disorganization in the Peking government
which was most unfortunate—the
failure to pay a loan due us at that moment.
Moreover, it soon became a matter of common
knowledge at the Conference that the
Peking government was failing to meet all
sorts of financial obligations at home as
well as abroad, that it was not paying the
salaries of its officials, its school-teachers.
There were delegates in Washington who, it
was claimed, had had no funds from their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>government for many months. A greater
part of the moneys collected seemed to go
into the pockets of the military chiefs of
the provinces, whose leading occupation
was to make life and property unsafe for
the rich and to prevent political conditions
becoming settled.</p>

<p class='c019'>All of this had an important relation to
these demands that the Chinese delegation
presented to the Conference. Take the matter
of tariff autonomy—nothing shows better
China’s position. She does not and has
not for many years controlled her customs.
They are fixed by treaty with the powers and
collected by them. They have been netting
her recently but 3½ per cent. on her importations.
Moreover, there have been vexatious
discriminations and special taxes which
have been both unfair and humiliating.
China came to the Conference begging for
freedom from all these restrictions. She
wanted a tariff autonomy like other nations,
and on the face of it what more reasonable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>request? And yet, after a very thorough
inquiry by a sub-committee of the Conference,
headed by Secretary Underwood, control
of her tariff was denied her. To be
sure, some of the worst of the discriminations
were cleared up. She was given a
rate which would immediately raise her
revenue by some $17,000,000, and the promise
of other changes in the near future which
would increase the amount to something
like $156,000,000. It looks small enough!</p>

<p class='c019'>But why should China’s tariffs remain in
the hands of foreigners? Why should she
not be allowed to collect more than an
effective 5 per cent. on her importations,
while her exportations to this country, for
instance, are weighted with tariffs all the
way from 20 to 100 per cent.? Why, simply
because the committee, after a long study
made, as it declares and as there is no reason
to doubt, in a spirit of sympathy and
friendliness, believed that tariff autonomy
would be a bad thing for China herself.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>When the committee presented its report,
Senator Underwood said: “I am sure this
sub-committee and the committee to which
I am now addressing myself would gladly
do much more for China if conditions in
China were such that the outside powers
felt they could do so with justice to China
herself. I do not think there was any doubt
in the minds of the sub-committee on this
question that, if China at present had the
unlimited control of levying taxes at the
customs house, in view of the unsettled conditions
now existing in China, it would
probably work in the end to China’s detriment
and to the injury of the world.”</p>

<p class='c019'>So far as tariff autonomy was concerned,
this judgment had to be accepted. It did
not, however, answer the question why
China should be able to collect but 5 per
cent. on the machinery we send her, and we
collect 35 to 50 per cent. on her silks. That
is, it does not seem that if the powers believe
that it is for the good of China that her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>duties should be kept at this low rate they
would feel, as a matter of fairness, that they
should grant reciprocity and collect no more
on her goods than she is allowed to collect
on theirs.</p>

<p class='c019'>When you come to the question of extra-territoriality,
by which is meant the establishment
and conduct of judicial courts by
foreigners in China, a humiliating condition
that dates back almost to the beginning of
her treaty relations with other countries,
you find her own delegates asking no more
than that the powers coöperate with China
in taking initial steps toward improving
and eventually abolishing the existing
system.</p>

<p class='c019'>There is no real solution of most of the
problems which the Chinese delegation
pleaded so eloquently and persistently in
Washington to have solved, except the establishment
within the country of a stable,
representative government. That is, if the
fine young Chinese that represented their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>country want to see their program carried
out, they must go back to China and work
within the country to secure order, education,
development of their people along modern
lines. There were too many Chinese
at the Washington Conference who had
spent the greater part of their lives in Europe
and America and who were actually
unfamiliar with home conditions.</p>

<p class='c019'>A stable Chinese Republic depends, then,
upon long, faithful efforts at reconstruction
as well as upon freeing China from foreign
encroachments. Not a few people came to
the Conference believing that the only problem
was to expel the Japanese from Shantung
and force her to withdraw her twenty-one
demands. If China had had a strong,
united government in the past there would
have been no Japanese now in Shantung,
and no twenty-one demands. Shantung is
a spoil of war and under the old code by
which the world has acquired power and
possessions “belonged” to Japan. That is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>her claim to it was as valid as the claim of
many nations, ourselves included, to certain
territories which we hold without dispute.
Japan pointed out that she had spent
blood and treasure for Shantung, and this
is true. And always when in the past men
spent blood and treasure, the world has
sanctioned their performance. Japan’s
right to Shantung was questioned now because
of the new code we are trying to put
in force. That is, men are trying to prove
that it shall be no longer by blood and
treasure that we progress, but by good will,
fair dealing, superior efficiency of mind and
hand. The practical question now seems to
be, When is this new code to begin to operate?
In 1922, as Japan wished, or with
the first entrance of the foreigner into
China, as radical Chinese wished? And if
it is to be adopted, is it to apply only to
China? The code that would sweep Japan
entirely out of China would also sweep us
out of the Philippines and Haiti; England
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>out of India and Egypt. There are strong
young nationalist parties to-day in the
Philippines and in Haiti, in India and in
Egypt, using the same arguments that the
Chinese delegation used in Washington,
that the foreigners shall go; and in all
of these countries as in China to-day, the
reason given by the protecting or invading
power, as you choose to regard it, that they
stay, is that their going would be the worst
thing in the world that could happen to the
country.</p>

<p class='c019'>In the case of Shantung and the twenty-one
demands, the solution was going to depend
upon how far Japan realized that these
“valid” claims of hers—that is, valid under
the old code—were handicaps and not advantages
to her. How far she realized that
by attempting to keep them in force she
was going to cripple her own real advancement
in China, increase and prolong the
boycott of her goods, and incur the ill will
of other nations, particularly of this nation.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>It became clear early in the Washington
Conference that we were not going to help
China’s case, or encourage Japan in generous
dealing by continuing to cultivate
mistrust and hatred of the Japanese. A
systematic effort to make one nation hate
another belongs to the old way of doing
things. Indeed, it has been one of the chief
methods by which we have thought to progress
in the world. You built up distrust,
dislike, suspicion, until you had created an
enemy in the minds of the mass of the people
so hateful that it became an almost
religious duty to overthrow it. We have
had this sort of thing going on in this country
in regard to Japan for years, a calculated,
nation-wide, extremely able effort to
make the American people fear and despise
the Japanese, to bring them to a point where
they would gladly, as a relief to their feelings,
undertake a war against Japan. I do
not know that a sterner rebuke to the American
public—the sterner because unconscious—could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>have been given than the remarks
of Prince Tokugawa in one of his little
talks before he sailed for home. He was
telling how surprised as well as grateful
the Japanese had been at American hospitality,
“Because,” he said, “when we came
we feared that the Americans were so hostile
to us that it might be impossible for us
to go with safety on the streets.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Those who know the Orient best all agree
that its future peace, and therefore the future
peace of the world, depends largely
upon Japan. She is the one strong, stable,
unified nation in the East. She has, it is
true, a powerful militaristic party, but opposed
to that is a great liberal group.
Prince Tokugawa, who played so fine a part
in his delegation during the Conference, is
a man who has taken keen interest in labor
questions, education of the people, the development
of industry, and has thrown all
his great interest against the military
spirit. It is said by those who know much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>of Japan’s interior workings that the Empress
herself is convinced that either the
empire must have a democratic leadership,
a constitutional monarchy with a responsible
cabinet, an army and navy under civil
control, or that it will be overthrown, and
that the reason that the young Crown Prince
was sent on his visit to England was that he
might have a look at a democratic monarchy.
There are many Japanese saying
openly in the press and in public assemblies
that the future of Japan depends upon an
entire change of policy, that the hard dealings
in Korea, the wresting of the twenty-one
demands from Peking, the methods in
Shantung have all been a mistake, that
Japan must deny them, correct the wrongs
done under them if she is to have the sympathy
and enjoy the coöperation of the outside
world. It is most important that the
people of the United States particularly
should understand these liberal leanings in
Japan, should give them all the support
within their power.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>There was much irritation at different
times in Washington because the Japanese
delegation insisted on holding up the march
of negotiations until it could hear from
Tokyo, and between Tokyo and poor cable
connections the answers were slow in coming.
The delegation always insisted on waiting,
however, and in this it was wise. It
could go no further safely than the government
at home would back it. If it attempted
to do so, it would mean the final
repudiation of the measures to which it had
agreed. Certainly Americans should have
understood this. It might take time for the
Japanese to stop at every point in the negotiations
to consult their government, but it
was a much safer method in the long run
than making such haste that a situation
could arise such as that between our own
delegation and the President of the United
States—the difference in the interpretation
of the Four Power Pact, a difference which
no doubt arose from a failure to see that
the busy President did have in his head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>just what the meaning of the short and
simple document really was. It sometimes
pays to make haste slowly.</p>

<p class='c019'>If the Japanese were cautious in their
dealings, haggled over details, were slow to
make concessions which it was likely they
intended all the time to make, gave up nothing
until they were sure they would be
backed by the home government, it might
be exasperating but it was not necessarily
a proof of intrigue or of a lack of sympathy
with the larger purposes of the Conference.
In spite of these methods so irritating to
people whose only thought is to put things
through in the shortest time possible, the
Japanese made a better impression on the
Conference than the Chinese, for the simple
reason that the one were workers, the other
talkers. More than once in the course of
the negotiations it was necessary to recall
the Chinese’s attention to the fact that what
was under discussion was not theories, but
conditions. All one’s sympathies were with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>the talkers, and all one’s practical sense
with the workers.</p>

<p class='c019'>The nations in adopting the principles
that they did in regard to China, in insuring
her a protecting ring within which they
promise to see that she has the chance to
develop and maintain effective and stable
government, and to give all nations an equal
opportunity of carrying on commerce and
industry with her, are attempting something
that has never before been done in
this world—they are insuring a great weak,
divided nation its chance. Never again
under the protection adopted, if the promises
made are kept, can anybody chip off a
piece of Chinese territory, secure a monopoly
of her resources; never again can
there be in China a Shantung, a Twenty-one
demands, a Port Arthur. The pacts
and principles adopted establish over China
that “moral trusteeship” of which Mr.
Hughes talks. They put upon all nations
agreeing and particularly upon this nation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>the obligation to see that this moral trusteeship
is something more than a phrase.</p>

<p class='c019'>Although the immediate results to China
are not as sweeping and generous as many
of her friends desire and many believe
would have been possible and wise, they are
substantial. She will control her own post
offices beginning with January, 1923; the
correction of the humiliating extra-territoriality
is being undertaken; foreign troops
will be withdrawn; a beginning at least
toward tariff autonomy has been made. No
future concessions and agreements will be
made by China to other powers except
under an international board of review, the
office of which will be to see that no terms
unjust to China or discriminatory in the
favor of any particular outside nation are
made. This leaves old commitments where
they are, but it is fair to suppose, if the
board does its duty, that any manifest injustice
or flagrant discrimination now existing
can and will be eventually cured.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>The Shantung question has been settled—settled
in the way that President Wilson
believed at Paris that it finally would be
settled—by Japan’s withdrawing. The real
bone of contention between the two countries—the
Tsingtau-Tsinanfu railway—will
go back entirely to China within a few
years—five at the shortest, fifteen at the
longest—upon terms of payment and of
management which, if painful to both countries—Japan
feeling that she is giving up
too much, China that she is getting too little—yet
seemed reasonable and the best
that could be done by the American and
British delegation.</p>

<p class='c019'>With the withdrawal of Japan from Shantung,
will go England’s from Weihaiwei,
and probably a little later, France’s from
Kwangchow-wan.</p>

<p class='c019'>As for the twenty-one demands, Japan so
thoroughly realized the discredit they had
brought her in the eyes of the liberal world
that she began the discussion upon them by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>voluntarily withdrawing one whole section,
that which compelled China to employ Japanese
advisers in the military, financial
and political departments of her government.
She also declared her intention to
give up her preferential rights in Southern
Manchuria and to open to the international
consortium the railway loans in Manchuria
and Mongolia which she has been holding as
her exclusive possession. This is going a
long way to clear up the difficulties under
the commitments. With this start and with
intelligent international supervision, it
ought to be possible in a reasonable time
to free China entirely from whatever is oppressive
in the twenty-one demands.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is a beginning. If Young China will
take hold vigorously now there is reason to
believe that the thongs about her feet will
in time be cut. She has work, long, slow
work, before her, but she is assured sympathy
and protection in carrying it on. That
is a vastly more important result than to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>have been granted all the demands of her
eager young democrats and left alone in
the world.</p>

<p class='c019'>It is the old, old story—nations must
climb step by step—they have no wings.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <span class='large'>THE MEASURE OF THE WASHINGTON CONFERENCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c020'>How are we to measure the Washington
Conference? There are people who think
it should be by the things that it did not
undertake to do. The Conference was indicted
in Washington in January by a
league of people of considerable ability who
declared that it had not lessened the chance
of war by a fraction of one per cent. The
reason they gave for this verdict was that
it had not taken up the causes of India,
Korea, the Far Eastern Republic, Persia,
the Philippines, Haiti, the “Republic of Mt.
Lebanon.”</p>

<p class='c019'>It is certain that the world is going to
have no quiet until these troubled countries
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>are satisfied. But they are not the
only problems to be solved. Mr. Hughes
named a considerable number on his
agenda. Is an international conference to
be declared a farce because it selects one
set of problems instead of another, and believes
it more practical to give exclusive attention
to one side of the globe than to the
entire surface? You could not persuade
Mr. Hughes and his colleagues that any
other policy than that of one thing at a time
would contribute a “fraction of one per
cent.” to the peace of the earth. They believe
the block system is the only practical
one for setting the world aright. They lay
it out something like this:</p>

<p class='c019'>“Let us clean up the Pacific, then we can
disarm. Having disarmed, we can lend a
hand in the next most distressed and troublesome
block—France, Central Europe,
Russia. Having helped set them straight,
one at a time, then possibly we may consider
an association of nations—but not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>now.” So convinced was Mr. Hughes of
the soundness of his system that he threw
out one of the chief subjects on his agenda—the
limitation of land armament—when
he discovered he must leave his block—the
Pacific—and pass into Europe if it was
considered.</p>

<p class='c019'>The only system a man can successfully
handle is that in which he has faith,—the
only fair way to judge what he does is by
what he undertakes to do—not what you
would like him to undertake. Measured
by the method it adopted and the limitations
it set for itself, how does the Conference
come out?</p>

<p class='c019'>I began my observations on the Conference
with a quarrel with the agenda. Putting
the problem of the limitation of armament
before the settlement of the difficulties
or threats of difficulties in the Pacific,
which were keeping the countries concerned
in arms, looked illogical. It proved good
psychology. The naval program stirred the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>imagination of the country, became at once
something tremendously desirable—a real
move toward peace. When England and
Japan at once agreed it became possible and
practical. If they agreed, why, then—it
must be—the difficulties could be settled
which many had doubted. The Conference
thus at the start gained what it needed most,
popular faith that it meant to do a concrete,
tangible thing. The proposition that
England, the United States, Japan, France
and Italy should adopt a naval ratio of
5–5–3, 1.75—1.25 and agree not to build
for ten years was a big, substantial, stirring
fact. To have them accept, as they did,
strengthened the faith of the world. It was
the first time big powers had ever said
“scrap,” had ever been actually eager for a
naval holiday.</p>

<p class='c019'>The fact that neither the submarine nor
the auxiliary craft are to be limited in tonnage,
as the original program proposed, if
disappointing, still does not upset the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>achievement. The submarine comes out of
the Conference unlimited in number but
crippled in its field of action. Merchant
ships are forbidden it on penalty of piracy.
That will not in the thick of war prevent
merchant ships being destroyed but it will
take the heart out of the business. Outlawry
helps if it does not prohibit. There is
compensation also in the failure in regard
to the tonnage of auxiliary craft, for at
least their size is limited—to 10,000 tons—and
their guns to 8 inches, and that is a
fairly satisfactory substitute for the original
proposal.</p>

<p class='c019'>In spite of the changes, cutting and trimming,
the naval program remains something
which the country wants, something
which it feels to be a blow at war as well
as a relief to its tax burdens.</p>

<p class='c019'>If the naval program could stand on its
own feet, it alone would make the Conference
a brilliant success, but it cannot. It
was no sooner raised to its feet than its
makers had to rush in with props. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>first was a policy in regard to China. The
reason was clear enough. Unless the nations
at the Conference could agree among
themselves on a method of assisting in the
development of China which would prevent
any one of them taking an unfair advantage
of the others, there were sure to be
quarrels sooner or later and they would
need their ships. Unless they could fix on
a policy under which not only they each had
a fair chance but nations outside—not at
the Conference, but likely in the future to
desire to invest in China—were not discriminated
against, they would need their ships.
They would surely need them, too, one of
these days, if they did not satisfy China that
what they agreed upon was as good for her
as for them.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Root hurried in with his four principles.
Mr. Hughes outlined his Nine Power
Pact, which was to assent to the principles
and the practical applications of them which
were to be worked out.</p>

<p class='c019'>But the naval program had to have another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>prop before it could proceed. It was
not worth the paper it was written on unless
England and Japan agreed to it. They
agreed in principle at the start, but in practice
they could and would not until they
were sure that the nation that was asking
them to disarm wanted peace in the Pacific
badly enough to join them in a league to assure
it by coöperation. Before they scrapped
their ships they wanted to know whether
their present boundaries and rights were to
be respected by their colleagues—whether
if one of them suffered aggression from without
the others were to remain indifferent or
were willing to pledge at least moral support.
The Four Power Pact was the prop
desired. England, the United States,
France and Japan agree in it to face the future
in the Pacific together. Pull out this
prop and your program for scrapping ships
and a naval holiday falls flat—as flat as
the disarmament of France has fallen and
for the same reason. If this Conference for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>the Limitation of Armament does nothing
more than to make the American public
understand better what has been at the bottom
of the conduct of France since the
Armistice, it will have been worth all it
cost.</p>

<p class='c019'>France has held up the peace of Europe,
delayed its reconstruction, lessened her own
chances of reparation, alienated her best
friends by her persistent militarism. Go
back to the peace treaty of 1919 when disarmament
was one of the fundamental principles
adopted by the allied nations. From
the start France’s argument in regard to disarmament
was that for her it was impossible
unless England and the United States
would guarantee her against aggression
from Germany—if they would do that she
would disarm. In order to get disarmament,
Mr. Wilson and Lloyd George agreed
to protect France against <em>unprovoked</em> attacks.
Our Senate refused to ratify the
agreement.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>Having no guarantees, France kept her
arms. Keeping her arms, the military
spirit spread, the military group grew
stronger. How strong recent events have
shown.</p>

<p class='c019'>One-third of the agenda of the Washington
Conference—that in regard to land disarmament—had
to be scrapped ten days
after the opening because a reduction of
land armament still meant to France a
guarantee, the same kind of a guarantee in
principle that a little later we gave to
Japan in order to make it possible for her
to agree with Great Britain and ourselves
on the naval program. Perhaps the greatest
achievement of the Conference on the
Limitation of Armament is its demonstration
that disarmament means a union of the
nations that disarm, that in no other way,
the world being what it is, can it be accomplished.</p>

<p class='c019'>Along with this demonstration has gone
another, frequently repeated, that this union
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>to which you are to pin your faith instead of
ships and armies, if it is to be permanent,
must be all inclusive.</p>

<p class='c019'>Again and again the Conference ran up
against the difficulty that although all the
nations represented in Washington might
make agreements to cut down their capital
ships, limit their auxiliary craft to 10,000
tons and their guns to 8 inches, put the
mark of pirate on a submarine that attacked
a merchant vessel, forbid chemical warfare,
limit the number of air-craft ships—any
one or all of these restrictions might overnight
be frustrated by one nation or a
group of nations outside of the alliance, entering
on an ambitious and aggressive campaign
of naval construction. That is, this
fine program for the limitation of armament—almost
certain to be carried out if
the Four Power Pact in regard to the waters
of the Pacific and the Nine Power Pact in
regard to the protection of China are ratified
by the different governments—still may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>be destroyed overnight by some part of the
world not included in this union for peace.
So obvious is this that the naval pact includes
an agreement that in case any one
of the signing nations finds itself in a dangerous
position in regard to an aggressive
neighbor, it shall have the right to withdraw.
Every step that has been taken in
the Washington Conference leads inevitably
to the conclusion that it is all or none—if
the work is to stand.</p>

<p class='c019'>The difficulty in the way of most people
and most nations accepting this conclusion
is that they do not believe any such union
of all nations practical. They cannot see
men of all races working together, settling
only by agreement the misunderstandings
that inevitably come up.</p>

<p class='c019'>If the Conference on the Limitation of
Armament has demonstrated the necessity
of world coöperation if we are to have peace,
it has also demonstrated its practicability.
Mr. Hughes started off by calling on the two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>nations which the people of this country
have for a long time regarded with the most
suspicion—the two nations against which
we have conducted a persistent campaign of
ill will—England and Japan. Yet for three
months the delegations of these two nations
worked with ours in the utmost friendliness.
Again and again I heard Mr. Hughes declare
that nobody could have been more
coöperative, as he expressed it, than the
delegates from England and Japan. It was
obvious that those countries were quite as
eager as ourselves to work out agreements
that would enable them to declare a naval
holiday. All those initial suspicions that
we had of England and Japan and that England
and Japan had of us did not prevent
the delegates of the three countries from
coming to conclusions on matters on which
they had differed. What it seems to prove
is that you can get peace by friendly negotiation,
that a coöperation of nations is not
a dream, that it is a reality.</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>What more amazing and convincing proof
of this than the fact that China and Japan
did, by conference, agree on Shantung?
Who would have believed it possible? What
made it possible was the faith and the wisdom
of Mr. Hughes and Mr. Balfour, their
determination that the Chinese and Japanese
should learn to work together. “Talk
it over” was their instruction. “The Shantung
question can only be settled peaceably
by yourselves.” It was one of the wisest,
one of the most significant decisions of the
Washington Conference. Day after day the
Chinese and Japanese held conversations—not
conferences. They talked, they quarreled.
Day after day they went home in
wrath and disgust, refusing suggested compromises,
pleading the danger of losing their
heads if they consented. If the Chinese delegates
offered Peking anything less than an
immediate and completely free Shantung,
they could never again pass the border of
China. If the Japanese gave up even what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>they had promised to give up, their lives
would not be worth a song in Tokyo. Yet,
day by day, Japan was giving in a little,
China becoming a little more coöperative.
Mr. Harding, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Balfour
stayed on the outside, genial but determined
friends—determined that these two Eastern
neighbors should begin now to settle their
disagreements. More than once, China
came to them: “Make Japan be good, great
friends. You know Shantung is ours.
Make her be good.”</p>

<p class='c019'>Patience won the day. It took thirty-eight
“conversations,” interminable cables,
breaks, returns, the constant counsel of
Mr. Balfour and Mr. Hughes—“Steady now,
steady. Don’t give it up. You must do it
yourselves”—to bring a final agreement between
the two nations. But in the end they
did settle the Shantung difficulty. It was
a tremendous victory for the new international
method of handling quarrels.</p>

<p class='c019'>How reasonable it is that it should be so.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>It is a direct attack on a difficulty not a
roundabout one by correspondence through
ambassadors. Face to face, you examine the
basis of suspicion. You ask, Is this true
or not? Are you doing so-and-so or not?
Do you aim to do so-and-so? Thus the
actual situation, not the imagined one, is arrived
at. It becomes the actual property of
a group of negotiators sitting at the same
table; and when the actuality is before
them all, being turned over and examined
by them all, adjustment is almost certain
<em>if there is good will</em>. And here you come to
the crux of the whole matter—you get no
adjustment unless the negotiators are working
in a spirit of good will.</p>

<p class='c019'>When I first set out to observe the Washington
Conference I looked up a man unusually
wise and experienced in international
affairs, one who for many years has
been collecting, arranging and explaining
the diplomatic adventures of men and of nations
so that each coming generation might
have, if it would, the materials from which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>to find out what men had already done in
making peace and, if it were wise enough,
why they so often had failed. I was in
search of just the material of which he of
all men knew most. “What shall I read
first?” I asked him. His instant reply was,
“Æsop’s Fables. That should be the textbook
of the Conference. Read Æsop,” he
said, “to see what they can do, and follow
with Don Quixote to see what they cannot
do.</p>

<p class='c019'>“But there is one book more important
than all for the Conference—the Gospels.
But not King James’ version. That is a
great and wonderful translation, but it has
done some harm in the world by not always
giving true values to great truths. It promises
peace on earth and good will to men.
But that is not what was promised. Peace
was promised to men of good will. The success
of the Conference will depend upon the
degree to which men of good will are able
to prevail over those of ill will.”</p>

<p class='c019'>This is the way it turned out in Washington.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>At every stage it was good will which
carried the undertaking forward. What
will happen now in the various countries
to which the pacts of the Conference go will
depend upon the spirit of the peoples to
which they are submitted, whether it be
malicious or charitable. Will there be good
will enough in Japan to make such rearrangements
of her claims in China that
Chinese bitterness and suspicion will be
removed? Will there be enough good will
in China to coöperate when these rearrangements
are made? Will there be
enough in the United States to accept the
pledges of mutual support which must be
made if the nations concerned are to limit
their armaments? Have we enough faith in
men to accept the only possible alternative
in the present world to unlimited armament,
and that is, a union of peoples pledged to
face misunderstandings at their beginning,
to separate them into their elements, and to
bring all the force of collective judgment
and intelligence to adjustment?</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>It may be that the United States does not
yet sufficiently understand that the principle
of unionism which is its strength is
a world principle, that one primary cause
of wars in this world is isolation, with its
necessity of being suspicious, on guard,
ready to strike—like a rattlesnake. Æsop
is a guide here, with his fable of the
bundle of sticks—sticks easy to break
if separated, unbreakable when bound
together.</p>

<p class='c019'>It may be that the Senate of the United
States will refuse to back this pact of good
will which is just as essential to carrying
out the program of limitation of naval armament
as a guarantee to France against unprovoked
aggression was two years ago (and
is still) to European disarmament. But,
refuse it or not, the day will come—and
nothing has ever demonstrated it more
clearly than the Washington Conference,—when
we are going to understand that the
world can only remain in peace through a
union which is a practical application of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>the brotherhood of man, not a limited
brotherhood of man, such as Mr. Wells
preached in his final comment on the Arms
Parley, but one including all men.</p>

<p class='c019'>Mr. Wells’ idea of a brotherhood of nations
is—or was!—one that includes not
every state of the world but “the peoples
who speak English, French, German, Spanish,
Italian and Japanese, with such states
as Holland and Norway and Bohemia, great
in quality if not great in power—sympathetic
in training and tradition.” He would
admit only people of like ideals, exclude
Russia, India, China. Could there be a
surer way to throw Russia and India and
China into an alliance against this so-called
“Brotherhood of Man”? Is there a surer
way to awaken an ambition for liberty, to
spread ideals than to share what you have
with those that seem to you—and yet never
in all respects are—backward nations? Is
there any brotherhood of man worthy the
name which does not include all men?</p>

<p class='c019'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>However we may feel about it as a nation
to-day, though we may ruin the present
program for limitation of armament by rejection
of its underlying pacts, the day will
surely come when we shall realize and admit
the fullest international association
and coöperation. It is the one real asset
humanity has carried from this war—the
sense of the oneness of the world, the impossibility
of order and progress and peace
except as each is allowed to develop its individuality,
in a free continuing union of
all.</p>

<p class='c019'>Eventually the Washington Conference
for the Limitation of Armament will be
judged by what it contributes to this union
of nations, exactly as all its predecessors
will be judged. The Washington Conference
is but one in a long chain of international
undertakings looking to peace. It
is built on the experience of many different
men, of many different countries, running
back literally for centuries. Its immediate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>predecessor was the Hague Conferences
and tribunal and the Paris Conference with
its resultant League of Nations. So far the
League of Nations is at once the most idealistic
and the most practical scheme men
have yet framed, the broadest in its scope
and the most democratic in its spirit. It
may prove that humanity is as yet too backward
to grasp and realize its intent and its
possibilities. It may make too great a demand
on their faith, their charity, their
love; but nothing can destroy the great fact
that it has been undertaken by fifty-one
nations, that it is alive and at work. That
fact will stand as a hope and a guide to the
future.</p>

<p class='c019'>The present Conference has boldly and
nobly attempted to do in a limited field
something of what the Paris Conference attempted
to do for the whole world. The
limitation of armament it proposes rests,
like world disarmament, on unionism,
standing together. Unionism requires
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>faith; have we enough of it? It requires,
too, men of good will. Have we enough of
them? In the final analysis, it is with them
that “peace on earth” rests.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
